			<p id="calibre_link-140" class="chapter-title-toc-level"><a id="calibre_link-11"></a>Introduction</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE ORIGIN OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Buddha presented his teachings in three main stages called the ‘three turnings of the <a id="calibre_link-141"></a>Wheel of Dharma’. He taught the first Wheel in the Deer Park at Benares, the second on Massed Vultures Mountain at Rajagriha and the third at Vaishali. During the second turning Buddha taught the <a id="calibre_link-142"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span> in which he revealed all the stages of the path to enlightenment. These are all included in the stages of the profound path and the stages of the <a id="calibre_link-143"></a>vast path. The stages of the <a id="calibre_link-144"></a>profound path include all the <a id="calibre_link-145"></a>wisdom practices that lead to a direct realization of emptiness and ultimately to the <a id="calibre_link-146"></a>Truth Body of a Buddha. The stages of the vast path include all the <a id="calibre_link-147"></a>method practices, from the initial cultivation of compassion through to the final attainment of the <a id="calibre_link-148"></a>Form Body of a Buddha.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The <span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span> are difficult to understand and Buddha himself predicted that after his death great scholars would appear to explain their meaning. As Buddha predicted, four hundred years after he passed away Protector <a id="calibre_link-149"></a>Nagarjuna appeared in this world. Guided by <a id="calibre_link-150"></a>Manjushri, he composed a number of works in which he clearly explained all the stages of the profound path that Buddha had taught in the <span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span>. These works include <a id="calibre_link-151"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way</span> (often referred to simply as <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span>) and its four limbs &ndash; <span class="italic">Sixty Reasonings</span>, <span class="italic">Seventy Emptinesses</span>, <span class="italic">Finely Woven</span> and <span class="italic">Refutation of Objections</span>. Approximately six hundred years later Superior Asanga, guided by Maitreya, provided a clear explanation of all the stages of the vast path.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Of the two, the stages of the <a id="calibre_link-152"></a>profound path are the more difficult to understand, which is why the works of Nagarjuna are so important. They are like a treasury in which the precious wisdom of emptiness is stored, but to gain access to this treasury great wisdom is needed. Unfortunately, the wisdom of the beings in this world had declined and so it was as if this precious treasury was locked. To unlock it, Nagarjuna’s principal disciple Chandrakirti composed a commentary entitled <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span>. This is an outstanding book that explains perfectly the stages of the profound and vast paths as taught by Nagarjuna. However, because the wisdom of the beings in this world has continued to decline, these days we find it difficult to understand even this text. For this reason I have prepared this book, <span class="italic">Ocean of Nectar</span>. I hope that with the help of this commentary many people will be able to study and practise <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">In writing this book I have relied on the works of <a id="calibre_link-153"></a>Je Tsongkhapa, especially his commentary to <a id="calibre_link-154"></a><span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> entitled <a id="calibre_link-155"></a><span class="italic">Clear Illumination of the Intention, an Extensive Explanation of the Great Treatise</span>, Guide to the Middle Way.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE PRE-EMINENT QUALITIES OF THE AUTHOR</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Before looking at the <span class="italic">Guide</span> itself it will be helpful to consider the biography of its author. <a id="calibre_link-156"></a>Chandrakirti was born to Brahmin parents in the Salona region of Southern India about a thousand years after Buddha had passed away. His parents soon realized that he was an unusual child and consulted an oracle about his future. The oracle predicted that he would become a great Buddhist scholar and Yogi. Inspired by this prophecy, Chandrakirti’s parents sent their son to the monastic university of <a id="calibre_link-157"></a>Nalanda where the Abbot <a id="calibre_link-158"></a>Chandranatha ordained him as a monk, giving him the name Chandrakirti. While at Nalanda, Chandrakirti studied under Nagarjuna who gave him many teachings on the Sutras and <a id="calibre_link-159"></a>Tantras. He was Nagarjuna’s last and principal disciple and Nagarjuna said of him:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">I gave my final teachings on non-production to my last disciple Chandrakirti.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Chandrakirti became proficient in all areas of the teachings and soon developed a great reputation as both a scholar and a Teacher. He was a conscientious disciple training day and night according to his Teacher’s instructions. As a result he developed a special meditative concentration and many extraordinary powers. One day his Abbot decided that it would be beneficial if Chandrakirti were to demonstrate his meditative powers and mental freedom to the other monks. To this end he appointed Chandrakirti as storekeeper to the monastery, a post that involved the great responsibility of looking after the <a id="calibre_link-160"></a>cows and buffaloes kept by the monastery to supply its dairy produce. Chandrakirti, however, refused to take milk from the animals because he felt it should be saved for their young and left them to wander freely on the neighbouring hills. Nevertheless, he still managed to provide the monks with an abundant supply of dairy produce!</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">One day Chandrakirti and his assistant Suryakirti were summoned before the Abbot and the assembled monks and asked to explain how they managed to provide such an abundant supply of food while the animals were roaming unattended on the hills. To the great delight of the entire assembly Suryakirti explained that Chandrakirti had painted a picture of a cow on a wall and was drawing from this picture all the milk that was required:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Glorious Chandrakirti perfectly sustains and nourishes the monks</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">By drawing milk from pictures of cows.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">While he was studying at Nalanda, Chandrakirti would often debate with a fellow student called <a id="calibre_link-161"></a>Chandragomin who was a lay practitioner. Though they were both great scholars and highly respected Teachers, conventionally they held different philosophical views. Chandragomin held the Chittamatra view and Chandrakirti held the Madhyamika-Prasangika view. Sometimes Chandragomin found it difficult to give answers to Chandrakirti’s penetrating questions and would ask if he could reply the following day. Then he would retire to his room and speak directly to <a id="calibre_link-162"></a>Avalokiteshvara, who would give him the correct answers. Chandrakirti assumed that Chandragomin was consulting other Chittamatrin Teachers. He had no idea that he was receiving help directly from Avalokiteshvara. Then one day Chandrakirti asked an especially difficult question that Chandragomin could not answer. Chandragomin said, ‘I will give you the answer tomorrow.’ Chandrakirti asked, ‘How will you be able to answer tomorrow what you cannot answer today?’ and Chandragomin replied, ‘I will ask Avalokiteshvara tonight and tomorrow I will give you the answer. If I cannot answer tomorrow, you will win the debate.’ That night Chandrakirti stole up to Chandragomin’s room and peeped through the window. To his amazement he saw Chandragomin talking directly to a manifestation of Avalokiteshvara! Chandragomin was asking questions and Avalokiteshvara was patiently giving answers. Chandrakirti was filled with awe and immediately developed a wish to meet Avalokiteshvara directly. He rushed into Chandragomin’s room, but as soon as he entered the Deity vanished.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Longing to meet Avalokiteshvara directly as Chandragomin had done, he returned to his room and practised the yoga of Buddha Avalokiteshvara repeatedly for many days. After a while he started to have visions of Avalokiteshvara in his dreams. Encouraged by this he practised even more earnestly, making heartfelt requests to Avalokiteshvara to appear directly to him. Then one day Avalokiteshvara manifested in front of him. Chandrakirti was delighted. ‘Now I can really benefit others’, he said to Avalokiteshvara, ‘please sit on my shoulders so I can show you to everyone else in the town.’ Avalokiteshvara replied that even though Chandrakirti could see him others would not be able to. Chandrakirti, however, continued to request strongly and so eventually Avalokiteshvara agreed. Chandrakirti took Avalokiteshvara on his shoulders and ran through the town, shouting to everyone to come to see his Spiritual Guide and make prostrations to him. As Avalokiteshvara had predicted, no one saw a thing, except one person with heavy karmic obscurations who saw Chandrakirti with a dead dog on his shoulders and a woman wine seller who saw Avalokiteshvara’s right foot. Even so, as a result of this slight vision the woman immediately gained a realization of higher concentration and a very peaceful mind.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Another incident that illustrates Chandrakirti’s extraordinary attainments occurred while a war known as the ‘<a id="calibre_link-163"></a>Dhuruka’ war was being waged in the region of <a id="calibre_link-164"></a>Nalanda monastery. As the fighting drew close to the monastery the local people and the ordinary monks became frightened and begged the scholars and Yogis to end it, but the situation was so dangerous that none of them felt able to help. The people were on the point of despair when suddenly a bird emerged from the heart of the statue of the monastery’s Protector and flew towards Chandrakirti’s house. Taking this as a sign, they requested Chandrakirti to help them. Chandrakirti agreed to their request and told them to make a lion out of stone, which they were to position fifteen miles to the north of the monastery in the direction of the fighting. He encouraged the Buddhists among them to pray to Buddha and the non-Buddhists to pray to <a id="calibre_link-165"></a>Ishvara. When the battle came in sight they were to shout to the lion to save them.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Very soon, soldiers appeared on the horizon and the people started shouting to the lion, but the lion did not move. Their confidence shaken, they began to doubt Chandrakirti’s abilities and some even accused him of deceiving them. Chandrakirti reassured them and set off towards the lion carrying a large stick of sandalwood. He beat the lion three times on the head and to everyone’s amazement it sprang to life! The lion ran off into the midst of the battle causing all the soldiers to flee in panic. Not one soldier was killed or harmed but the war ended and peace was brought to the region. Out of gratitude the king later composed the following verse of praise to Chandrakirti:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Through the power of Glorious Chandrakirti</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">The mighty stone lion came to life</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">And without a single person being harmed</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Brought the Dhuruka war to an end.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are many other stories that illustrate the remarkable powers that Chandrakirti acquired through his meditative concentration. Right now we may find it difficult even to imagine such powers but if we consider this sincerely we will understand that Yogis such as Chandrakirti have many special powers that they display when the time is right.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-166"></a>Manjushri told <a id="calibre_link-167"></a>Je Tsongkhapa that Chandrakirti had manifested from the Eastern Buddha Land to help the beings of this world. Chandrakirti has helped us in many ways, but his greatest contribution has been to explain the works of Nagarjuna, especially his teachings on the profound view of the <a id="calibre_link-168"></a>middle way and the path of <a id="calibre_link-169"></a>Secret Mantra. Through these explanations we are able to realize the final meaning of Buddha’s teachings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below"><a id="calibre_link-170"></a>Chandrakirti composed many books, most of which are commentaries to Buddha’s Sutras and <a id="calibre_link-171"></a>Tantras and to the works of Nagarjuna. His most famous work is <a id="calibre_link-172"></a><span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span>. In this work, together with its <a id="calibre_link-173"></a><span class="italic">Autocommentary</span>, Chandrakirti clearly illuminates all the stages of the profound and the vast paths revealed in the <a id="calibre_link-174"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span>. He also wrote another commentary to Nagarjuna’s <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> called <a id="calibre_link-175"></a><span class="italic">Clear Words</span> and a commentary to the <span class="italic">Root Tantra of Guhyasamaja</span> called <span class="italic">Clear Lamp</span>. These two incomparable works are well known amongst Buddhist scholars and Teachers. An old proverb says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">In the sky there are the sun and the moon and on earth there are the two <span class="italic">Clears</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Besides these, Chandrakirti wrote commentaries to Nagarjuna’s <span class="italic">Sixty Reasonings</span> and <span class="italic">Seventy Emptinesses</span> and a commentary to Aryadeva’s <span class="italic">Four Hundred</span>. His other works include <span class="italic">Seventy Verses on Refuge</span>, <span class="italic">Discriminating the Five Aggregates</span>, a sadhana entitled <span class="italic">Clear Realization of Guhyasamaja</span>, a sadhana of Vajrasattva and praises to Tara.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The actual commentary to <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> is presented under four main headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The meaning of the title</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	The translators’ homage</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">3	The meaning of the text</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">4	The meaning of the conclusion</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE MEANING OF THE TITLE</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para"><a id="calibre_link-176"></a><span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> was composed in Sanskrit with the title <a id="calibre_link-177"></a><span class="italic">Madhyamakavatara</span>. It was later translated into Tibetan as <span class="italic">Uma la jugpa</span>. Now it is translated into English as <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span>. What is the ‘Middle Way’ referred to in the title? Generally, the term ‘<a id="calibre_link-178"></a>middle way’ refers to anything that is free from the <a id="calibre_link-179"></a>two extremes of existence and non-existence and more specifically to ultimate truth, emptiness. In this context, however, it refers specifically to Nagarjuna’s text <a id="calibre_link-180"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way</span>, which is so called because its main subject matter is profound <a id="calibre_link-181"></a>emptiness. Often when Chandrakirti cites this work he refers to it simply as the ‘<span class="italic">Middle Way</span>’ and so when he composed the <span class="italic">Guide</span> as a commentary to <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> he gave it the title <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span>. Thus, whereas in the title of Nagarjuna’s book the phrase ‘Middle Way’ refers to emptiness, in the title of Chandrakirti’s book it refers to <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> itself. <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span>, therefore, acts as a guide to those who wish to practise the meaning of <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The term <span class="italic">Guide</span> in the title also has great meaning, for the work acts as a guide to both the stages of the <a id="calibre_link-182"></a>profound path and the stages of the <a id="calibre_link-183"></a>vast path. In the first sense, <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> guides us to an understanding of the meaning of profound emptiness as explained in <a id="calibre_link-184"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span>. Previously some of Nagarjuna’s other disciples such as <a id="calibre_link-185"></a>Bhavaviveka had written commentaries to <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> from the viewpoint of the Madhyamika-Svatantrika tenets. In <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> Chandrakirti conclusively refutes this interpretation and establishes the uncommon <a id="calibre_link-186"></a>Madhyamika-Prasangika view as the most profound view. He also provides an extensive refutation of the tenets of the Chittamatra school and shows that it is also inappropriate to interpret <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> from the point of view of these tenets. Thus, if we rely on <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> we will realize the uncommon view of the Madhyamika-Prasangika school and as a result our practice of emptiness will be superior to that of practitioners of other tenets. This is the way in which <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> acts as a guide to the stages of the profound path.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">How does <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> act as a guide to the stages of the vast path? Nagarjuna explained the stages of the vast path in works such as <a id="calibre_link-187"></a><span class="italic">Precious Garland</span> and <a id="calibre_link-188"></a><span class="italic">Compendium of Sutras</span>. Chandrakirti took these explanations and added them to the <span class="italic">Guide</span>. In the <span class="italic">Guide</span>, therefore, we find not only a faultless presentation of the most profound view of emptiness but also a clear explanation of the stages of the vast path. These include the <a id="calibre_link-189"></a>three Dharmas of ordinary Mahayanists, the ten <a id="calibre_link-190"></a>grounds of Superior Bodhisattvas and the <a id="calibre_link-191"></a>resultant grounds of Buddhahood. This is the way in which <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> acts as a guide to the stages of the vast path.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Nagarjuna did not explicitly teach the stages of the vast path in <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span>, but this does not mean that it is not a Mahayana text. <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> gives an extensive presentation of <a id="calibre_link-192"></a>selflessness of phenomena using many different forms of reasoning and such presentations are intended only for Mahayana disciples. Therefore <a id="calibre_link-193"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> is a Mahayana text. However, if we were to rely on <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> alone we would be able to practise only the stages of the <a id="calibre_link-194"></a>profound path, whereas if we rely on <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> we can practise the union of the vast and profound paths.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">If we understand clearly how the <span class="italic">Guide</span> acts as a guide to <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> we will understand the meaning of its title, <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE <a id="calibre_link-195"></a>TRANSLATORS’ HOMAGE</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single"><span class="bold">Homage to youthful </span><span class="bold"><a id="calibre_link-196"></a></span><span class="bold">Manjushri</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The Tibetan translators of <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> such as <a id="calibre_link-197"></a>Patsab Nyimadrak included a homage to youthful Manjushri at the beginning of the text. The principal purpose of a translator’s homage is to remove obstacles and ensure that the translation is completed, but it also performs a secondary function of indicating to which class of scripture the text belongs. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Traditionally <a id="calibre_link-198"></a>Buddhist scriptures are classified according to which of the <a id="calibre_link-199"></a>three higher trainings they emphasize &ndash; training in higher moral discipline, training in higher concentration or training in higher wisdom. A text that mainly emphasizes training in higher moral discipline belongs to the set of <a id="calibre_link-200"></a>Vinaya, or Discipline, one that mainly emphasizes training in higher concentration belongs to the set of <a id="calibre_link-201"></a>Sutra, or Discourses, and one that mainly emphasizes training in higher wisdom belongs to the set of Abhidharma, or Phenomenology. Texts belonging to the set of Vinaya would be preceded by a homage to the Omniscient One, those belonging to the set of Sutra by a homage to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and those belonging to the set of <a id="calibre_link-202"></a>Abhidharma by a homage to youthful Manjushri. Since this text is preceded by a homage to youthful Manjushri, we know that it is included within the set of Abhidharma, that it mainly emphasizes training in higher wisdom and that its principal subject matter is profound emptiness.</p>

			<p class="text-heading">THE MEANING OF THE TEXT</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The meaning of the text is explained under four headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The expression of worship, the means for engaging in the composition of the treatise</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	The actual body of the treatise</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">3	How the treatise was composed</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">4	Dedicating the merit from composing the treatise</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE EXPRESSION OF WORSHIP, THE MEANS FOR ENGAGING IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE TREATISE</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">It is customary to begin a text with an <a id="calibre_link-204"></a>expression of worship, paying homage to the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Solitary Realizers and Hearers. Chandrakirti, however, does not praise these holy beings directly but begins by praising the mind of <a id="calibre_link-205"></a>great compassion. His purpose is to show that great compassion is the cause of all these <a id="calibre_link-206"></a>holy beings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The expression of worship is in two parts, which are explained under the following two headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Praising great compassion without distinguishing its types</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	A homage to great compassion distinguishing its types</p>
			<p class="text-heading">PRAISING GREAT COMPASSION WITHOUT DISTINGUISHING ITS TYPES</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This has two parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Showing great compassion to be the principal cause of a Bodhisattva</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Showing great compassion to be the root of the other two causes of a Bodhisattva</p>
			<p class="text-heading">SHOWING GREAT COMPASSION TO BE THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF A BODHISATTVA</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The root text begins:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.1] Hearers and Middling Buddhas (Solitary Realizers) are born from Buddhas, the Powerful Able Ones,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Buddhas are born from Bodhisattvas,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And the mind of compassion, the wisdom of non-duality</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">And bodhichitta are the causes of Conquerors’ Sons.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">We can distinguish four types of holy being &ndash; <a id="calibre_link-207"></a>Hearers, <a id="calibre_link-208"></a>Solitary Realizers, <a id="calibre_link-209"></a>Bodhisattvas and <a id="calibre_link-210"></a><a id="calibre_link-211"></a>Buddhas. The first two are <a id="calibre_link-212"></a>Hinayanists and the last two are Mahayanists. Hinayanists are motivated by the wish to attain <a id="calibre_link-213"></a>liberation from samsara for themselves alone whereas <a id="calibre_link-214"></a>Mahayanists are motivated by the wish to attain full enlightenment for the sake of all living beings. In this verse, Chandrakirti explains how Hearer and Solitary Realizer <a id="calibre_link-215"></a><a id="calibre_link-216"></a>Foe Destroyers arise from Buddhas, who in turn arise from Bodhisattvas. He then explains the <a id="calibre_link-217"></a>three principal causes of a <a id="calibre_link-218"></a>Bodhisattva and shows how within these the mind of great compassion is the root cause. These explanations will now be presented extensively under three headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	How Hearers and Solitary Realizers are born from Buddhas</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	How Buddhas are born from Bodhisattvas</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">3	The three principal causes of a Bodhisattva</p>
			<p class="text-heading">HOW HEARERS AND SOLITARY REALIZERS ARE BORN FROM BUDDHAS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">A Hearer is a practitioner who has entered the <a id="calibre_link-219"></a>Hinayana path, listens to correct teachings and by meditating on their meaning attains a small <a id="calibre_link-220"></a>enlightenment, or mere liberation. Having attained a small enlightenment he or she then causes others to hear of this fact by announcing, ‘I have practised just as I have heard; from now on I will not know another rebirth in samsara.’ The Sanskrit word for <a id="calibre_link-221"></a>Hearer, <a id="calibre_link-222"></a><span class="italic">Sravaka</span>, also means ‘Hearer-proclaimer’. In this sense a Hearer is one who listens to Buddha’s Mahayana teachings and, without practising them himself, proclaims them to others who are seeking enlightenment. This shows that merely listening to Mahayana teachings and passing them on to others does not make us a <a id="calibre_link-223"></a>Mahayanist, for even Hearers do this. Moreover, without the motivation of <a id="calibre_link-224"></a>renunciation we cannot even call ourself a Hearer!</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">To attain <a id="calibre_link-225"></a>liberation from samsara a <a id="calibre_link-226"></a><a id="calibre_link-227"></a>Hearer must progress through five spiritual paths &ndash; the Hearers’ <a id="calibre_link-228"></a>paths of accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation and No More Learning. When a Hearer enters the Hearers’ path of seeing he or she becomes a Hearer Superior. There are eight levels of Hearer Superior &ndash; approachers to the accomplishment of a <a id="calibre_link-229"></a>Stream Enterer, abiders in the accomplishment of a Stream Enterer, approachers to the accomplishment of a Once Returner, abiders in the accomplishment of a Once Returner, approachers to the accomplishment of a Never Returner, abiders in the accomplishment of a Never Returner, approachers to the accomplishment of a Foe Destroyer and abiders in the accomplishment of a Foe Destroyer.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">When a <a id="calibre_link-230"></a>Hearer realizes emptiness directly he or she attains the Hearers’ path of seeing and becomes an approacher to the accomplishment of a Stream Enterer. In the same meditation session he or she will become an abider in the accomplishment of a Stream Enterer who has abandoned all <a id="calibre_link-231"></a>intellectually-formed <a id="calibre_link-232"></a>delusions. When he attains the direct antidote to big-big <a id="calibre_link-233"></a>innate <a id="calibre_link-234"></a>delusions he becomes an approacher to the accomplishment of a Once Returner and when he has abandoned the first six levels of <a id="calibre_link-235"></a>desire realm <a id="calibre_link-236"></a>delusion, from big-big to small-middling, he becomes an abider in the accomplishment of a Once Returner. This name indicates that if he died at this stage he would have to return one more time to the desire realm. When he begins principally abandoning the last three levels of desire realm delusion, big-small to small-small, he becomes an approacher to the accomplishment of a Never Returner and when he has abandoned these delusions he becomes an abider in the accomplishment of a Never Returner. This name indicates that he or she will never again be reborn in the desire realm. When he begins principally abandoning the <a id="calibre_link-237"></a><a id="calibre_link-238"></a>delusions of the <a id="calibre_link-239"></a>form and <a id="calibre_link-240"></a>formless realms he becomes an approacher to the accomplishment of a <a id="calibre_link-241"></a>Foe Destroyer. When he has abandoned these delusions together with their seeds he becomes an abider in the accomplishment of a Foe Destroyer and attains the Hearers’ Path of No More Learning and a small <a id="calibre_link-242"></a>enlightenment. According to the Madhyamika-Svatantrika school, an approacher to the accomplishment of a <a id="calibre_link-243"></a>Stream Enterer can be on either the path of preparation or the path of seeing, but according to the Madhyamika-Prasangika school he or she must be a Superior being.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-244"></a>Solitary Realizers, or Solitary Conquerors, are superior to Hearers from many points of view, but they are inferior to Mahayanists. Whereas Hearers seek only to escape from the sufferings of samsara, Solitary Realizers seek to realize their full potential by attaining Buddhahood. However, unlike <a id="calibre_link-245"></a>Mahayanists, they wish to attain Buddhahood only for their own sake, not for the sake of all living beings. This motivation enables them to attain a higher enlightenment than that attained by Hearers, but it does not enable them to attain the great <a id="calibre_link-246"></a>enlightenment of the Mahayana.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Generally, through the force of their practice in previous lives, <a id="calibre_link-247"></a>Solitary Realizers have greater wisdom than Hearers, but they have less wisdom than Mahayanists. For example, Hearers generate <a id="calibre_link-248"></a>renunciation for samsara by contemplating the <a id="calibre_link-249"></a>four noble truths, but Solitary Realizers generate renunciation by contemplating the twelve dependent-related links. There is a story about a Solitary Realizer who went to a cemetery where he saw some human bones. He asked himself, ‘Where did these bones come from?’ and realized that they came from death. Then he asked, ‘Where does death come from?’ and realized that the cause of death is birth. Contemplating further, he realized that birth is caused by existence, the tenth dependent-related link, existence by grasping, grasping by craving and so on back to the root cause, ignorance. In this way he realized that to escape from samsara, the cycle of twelve dependent-related links, he must abandon ignorance. Moreover, he understood that since the bones depended on death, death on birth and so on, all these things lack inherent existence. In this way he realized emptiness. This story shows how through the power of their wisdom Solitary Realizers use everyday experiences to deepen their awareness of dependent relationship and emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">As a result of their study and practice in previous lives Solitary Realizers naturally have a profound understanding of the five aggregates, the eighteen elements, the twelve sources, the twelve dependent-related links, the four noble truths and the two truths, and actions and their effects. They lead very pure and disciplined lives, living alone and not going out any more than is necessary. They practise restraining the sense doors very conscientiously and try to avoid all distracting activities. They do not like to speak much because it can be distracting. Therefore when they teach they often resort to hand gestures, signs and so forth. Rather than living in large Dharma communities, they tend to live in isolated places and teach only selected disciples.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">When through meditating on the twelve dependent-related links Solitary Realizers develop spontaneous renunciation they enter the Solitary Realizers’ <a id="calibre_link-250"></a>path of accumulation. In the scriptures it says that on this path they accumulate merit for a hundred aeons, but the meaning is that they accumulate as much merit as an ordinary being would accumulate in a hundred aeons. After completing the path of accumulation they try to complete the remaining paths &ndash; the Solitary Realizers’ paths of preparation, seeing, meditation and No More Learning &ndash; in one life.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Through the force of their superior wisdom Solitary Realizers abandon <a id="calibre_link-251"></a>desire realm <a id="calibre_link-252"></a>delusions, <a id="calibre_link-253"></a>form realm delusions and <a id="calibre_link-254"></a>formless realm <a id="calibre_link-255"></a><a id="calibre_link-256"></a>delusions simultaneously. Thus, as they abandon the big-big delusions of the desire realm they simultaneously abandon the big-big delusions of the form and formless realms and so on.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Some Solitary Realizers pray that in their final rebirth they will be born in a place where there are no Buddhas or Hearers. Because they have great merit and wisdom and have completed their studies they do not need to rely directly on a <a id="calibre_link-257"></a>Spiritual Guide in their final rebirth. In general, to attain enlightenment it is necessary to rely on a Spiritual Guide and this applies even to Solitary Realizers, but it is not necessary always to be in the physical presence of a Spiritual Guide. When we have thoroughly understood our Spiritual Guide’s teachings we can retire into solitude to gain deep experience of them through meditation. Thus, a Solitary Realizer’s final rebirth is like a life-long solitary retreat. The scriptures refer to such practitioners as ‘rhinoceros-like <a id="calibre_link-258"></a>Solitary Realizers’ because just as a rhinoceros lives in solitude, so these practitioners dwell in spiritual solitude in their final rebirth. When a Solitary Realizer attains the Solitary Realizers’ Path of No More Learning, he or she becomes a Solitary Realizer <a id="calibre_link-259"></a>Foe Destroyer and attains a middling <a id="calibre_link-260"></a>enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Because Solitary Realizers are superior to Hearers but inferior to <a id="calibre_link-261"></a>Mahayanists, Chandrakirti calls them ‘Middling <a id="calibre_link-262"></a>Buddhas’. Here, the term ‘Buddha’ does not refer to a fully enlightened being because fully enlightened beings cannot be classified as small, middling and great. The Sanskrit term ‘Buddha’ has many meanings and although it usually refers to enlightened beings, in this context it means ‘realizer’ and in particular a realizer of emptiness. Generally there are three levels on which emptiness can be realized &ndash; small, middling and great. Those who attain a small <a id="calibre_link-263"></a>realization of emptiness are small realizers, or <a id="calibre_link-264"></a>Hearers, those who attain a middling realization are middling realizers, or Solitary Realizers, and those who attain a great realization are great realizers, or Mahayanists.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">When <a id="calibre_link-265"></a>Buddhas appear in this world they give perfect teachings on profound <a id="calibre_link-266"></a>dependent relationship. Hearers and Solitary Realizers listen to these teachings, contemplate the meaning of what they have heard and meditate on the meaning they have contemplated. Through this meditation they attain liberation from samsara and become Foe Destroyers. Even Solitary Realizers who dwell in solitude in their final lives become Foe Destroyers in dependence on the speech of Buddhas that they have heard in their previous lives. Thus the meaning of the first line of the root text is that Hearers and Solitary Realizers become Foe Destroyers in dependence on the speech of Buddhas. The root text says ‘Powerful Able Ones’, which is an epithet for Buddhas.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">HOW BUDDHAS ARE BORN FROM BODHISATTVAS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">If Hearer and Solitary Realizer <a id="calibre_link-267"></a><a id="calibre_link-268"></a>Foe Destroyers are born from Buddhas, from what causes do <a id="calibre_link-269"></a>Buddhas arise? Chandrakirti gives the answer in the second line, where he explains that Buddhas are born from <a id="calibre_link-270"></a>Bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas are both substantial causes and circumstantial causes of Buddhas. To attain enlightenment a Mahayana practitioner must first become a Bodhisattva by attaining a spontaneous realization of bodhichitta. Then, by completing all the stages of the Bodhisattva training he or she will eventually become a Buddha. In this sense, a Buddha is born from the Bodhisattva of his own previous continuum, who is his substantial cause.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">While training on the Mahayana paths the Bodhisattva relies on teachings from other Bodhisattvas. By putting these teachings into practice he or she progresses through the <a id="calibre_link-271"></a>Mahayana paths of accumulation, preparation, seeing and meditation and finally attains the Mahayana Path of No More Learning, or Buddhahood. In this sense, a Buddha is born from the speech of Bodhisattvas of other continuums who are his or her circumstantial causes.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE THREE PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF A <a id="calibre_link-272"></a>BODHISATTVA</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">If Hearers and Solitary Realizer Foe Destroyers are born from Buddhas and Buddhas are born from Bodhisattvas, from what causes do Bodhisattvas arise? In the last two lines of the first verse Chandrakirti explains that there are three principal <a id="calibre_link-273"></a>causes of Bodhisattvas &ndash; the mind of <a id="calibre_link-274"></a>great compassion, the <a id="calibre_link-275"></a>wisdom of non-duality associated with bodhichitta and <a id="calibre_link-276"></a>bodhichitta. Sometimes, these three minds are called the ‘<a id="calibre_link-277"></a>three Dharmas of the expression of worship’. In this context, the term ‘worship’ implies that ordinary Bodhisattvas become Superior Bodhisattvas by taking these three Dharmas as their main practice. From this we can understand that as well as explaining the causes of a Bodhisattva this instruction on the three Dharmas in the expression of worship also reveals the grounds and paths of ordinary Bodhisattvas &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-278"></a><a id="calibre_link-279"></a>Mahayana paths of accumulation and preparation. Chandrakirti says that within the three Dharmas compassion is the root of the other two; therefore it will be helpful if we examine them in reverse order.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Bodhichitta is a spontaneous wish to attain full enlightenment for the sake of all living beings. This special mind does not arise naturally but has to be cultivated with effort for a long time. Eventually, through the force of strong familiarity, it arises naturally without effort and remains constant. This constant, spontaneous mind is actual <a id="calibre_link-280"></a>bodhichitta. As soon as we generate it we enter the <a id="calibre_link-281"></a>Mahayana path and become a Bodhisattva. Therefore, bodhichitta is called ‘the gateway to the Mahayana’.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Objection</span> If we become a Bodhisattva as soon as we generate bodhichitta, how can bodhichitta be a cause of a Bodhisattva? Surely a cause must precede its effect not occur simultaneously with it?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Reply</span> There is no contradiction here because Chandrakirti is referring to artificial, or cultivated, <a id="calibre_link-282"></a>bodhichitta, not to the actual mind of bodhichitta. Before generating actual, spontaneous bodhichitta and becoming a Bodhisattva a Mahayana practitioner will spend a long time cultivating a strong wish to become a Buddha for the benefit of all living beings. This cultivated mind is called ‘bodhichitta’ but it is not actual bodhichitta. Actual bodhichitta is necessarily a spontaneous mind that arises without effort. In <a id="calibre_link-283"></a><span class="italic">Sutra Requested by Those with Superior Intention</span> Buddha says that the cultivated mind is like the bark of sugar cane whereas the spontaneous mind is like its core. The bark of sugar cane tastes sweet but it is not as sweet as the core. In the same way, cultivated bodhichitta is effective in directing us towards enlightenment but it is not as effective as the spontaneous mind.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The second cause, the wisdom of non-duality, is wisdom realizing emptiness. It is so called because it is free from the <a id="calibre_link-284"></a>two extremes &ndash; the extreme of existence and the extreme of non-existence. Both Hinayana and Mahayana practitioners generate the wisdom of non-duality but it is a cause of a <a id="calibre_link-285"></a>Bodhisattva only when it is in the continuum of a practitioner in the Mahayana lineage, in which case it is known as ‘the <a id="calibre_link-286"></a>wisdom of non-duality associated with bodhichitta’.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> If the wisdom of non-duality is a cause of a Bodhisattva, does this mean that we must realize emptiness before we can generate bodhichitta?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> No. There are some practitioners who do not realize emptiness until after they have generated bodhichitta and become Bodhisattvas. However, those with sharp faculties realize emptiness first, and it was to such Bodhisattvas that Buddha taught the <a id="calibre_link-287"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span>. By saying that the wisdom of non-duality is a cause of a Bodhisattva, Chandrakirti is indicating that the <span class="italic">Guide</span> too is addressed mainly to practitioners with sharp faculties.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The two preceding causes arise from the mind of <a id="calibre_link-288"></a>great compassion, for without great compassion it is impossible to develop either bodhichitta or the wisdom of non-duality associated with bodhichitta. Therefore Chandrakirti says that great compassion is the root of the other two causes.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">To summarize, we can identify four types of Superior being &ndash; Hearer <a id="calibre_link-289"></a>Superiors, Solitary Realizer <a id="calibre_link-290"></a>Superiors, Bodhisattva <a id="calibre_link-291"></a>Superiors and <a id="calibre_link-292"></a>Buddha <a id="calibre_link-293"></a>Superiors. Hearer Superiors and Solitary Realizer Superiors arise from Buddha Superiors, Buddha Superiors arise from Bodhisattva Superiors, Bodhisattva Superiors arise from bodhichitta and the wisdom of non-duality associated with bodhichitta, and these two minds in turn arise from the mind of great compassion. Therefore great compassion is the root of all spiritual paths and of all Superior beings. To emphasize this and to show that meditation on compassion is the essential practice, Chandrakirti directly praises the mind of great compassion rather than Hearers, Solitary Realizers, Bodhisattvas and Buddhas.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Because great <a id="calibre_link-294"></a>compassion is so important we need to understand what it is and how it is generated. Compassion is a virtuous mind that wishes others to be free from suffering. We all have some compassion but the compassion we have for our friends and relatives is often mixed with <a id="calibre_link-295"></a>attachment and so is not pure. The scriptures warn us not to mistake attachment for compassion. Pure compassion is unmixed with attachment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Pure compassion is also free from partiality. Although at first we naturally discriminate, feeling compassion for some and not for others, we must train in meditation to extend the scope of our compassion until it embraces all living beings without exception. Even then, if our compassion remains a simple wish for others to be free from suffering it will not be the great compassion of the <a id="calibre_link-296"></a>Mahayana. Great compassion is a wish to <span class="italic">protect</span> all living beings from their suffering. This is the most precious mind of all and it arises only in those who are in the <a id="calibre_link-297"></a>Mahayana lineage. <a id="calibre_link-298"></a>Hinayanists can wish for all living beings to be free from suffering but they never develop the wish actually to protect them from suffering.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">We can understand the difference between <a id="calibre_link-299"></a>Hinayana compassion and Mahayana compassion by considering the following analogy. Suppose a young child falls into a river and is in danger of <a id="calibre_link-300"></a>drowning. Everyone who witnesses this naturally wishes for the child to be saved, but they do not necessarily wish to save the child themselves. The child’s mother on the other hand does not simply wish for the child to be saved, she immediately generates a determination to save the child herself. Hinayanists are like the onlookers in this analogy, for they want all living beings to be free from suffering but do not want to take on the responsibility of protecting them themselves. Mahayanists, on the other hand, are like the mother, for not only do they want all living beings to be free from suffering, they also take personal responsibility for protecting them.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-301"></a>Great compassion is a noble mind and those who possess it are noble beings. Usually we associate nobility with external status and wealth, but the true nobility are those who have overcome their non-virtuous <a id="calibre_link-302"></a>minds and cultivated virtuous minds such as great compassion. Very often those whom we regard as distinguished such as monarchs, political leaders, business people and celebrities still have the same attitudes and intentions as ordinary people; therefore they too are ordinary. Indeed it is often the case that as people become rich or famous they become more distracted by objects of delusion and so their non-virtuous minds increase and their virtuous <a id="calibre_link-303"></a>minds diminish. Under the influence of these non-virtuous minds they engage in non-virtuous actions and as a result experience more problems and more suffering.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Any mind that causes problems or suffering is a non-virtuous mind and is to be abandoned, and any mind that causes peace and <a id="calibre_link-304"></a>happiness is a virtuous mind and is to be cultivated. It is utterly impossible for great compassion to cause problems or suffering. On the contrary, it is a cause of peace and happiness both for ourself and for others. Compassion causes us to experience happiness because once we generate it our disturbing minds such as <a id="calibre_link-305"></a>pride, <a id="calibre_link-306"></a>jealousy, <a id="calibre_link-307"></a>anger and attachment are pacified and our mind becomes very peaceful. It causes others to experience happiness because when we have great compassion we naturally care for others and try to help them whenever we can.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">To generate pure <a id="calibre_link-308"></a>compassion for someone we must first develop <a id="calibre_link-309"></a>affectionate love for them and then with this mind repeatedly reflect on their suffering. If we feel affection for someone we naturally feel compassion for them when we become aware of their <a id="calibre_link-310"></a>suffering. Thus we naturally generate compassion for our friends and relatives but find it difficult to generate the same feelings for strangers and enemies. From this we can see that if we want to generate great compassion for all living beings we must first train in affectionate love for all living beings. This is why all the great Mahayana meditators regard the realization of affectionate love as fundamental.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Traditionally, there are two methods for developing affectionate love &ndash; one taught by Shantideva and one taught by Chandrakirti and Chandragomin. These are explained extensively in the books <a id="calibre_link-311"></a><span class="italic">Joyful Path of Good Fortune</span>, <a id="calibre_link-312"></a><span class="italic">Meaningful to Behold</span> and <a id="calibre_link-313"></a><span class="italic">Universal Compassion</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">SHOWING GREAT COMPASSION TO BE THE ROOT OF THE OTHER TWO CAUSES OF A <a id="calibre_link-314"></a>BODHISATTVA</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.2] Because for this bountiful harvest of the Conquerors</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Compassion itself is like the seed, like water for growth</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And like ripening remaining for long enjoyment,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">At the beginning I praise compassion.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">If we want to reap a bountiful <a id="calibre_link-315"></a>harvest we must first sow the seeds, then tend to their growth with water and so forth and finally allow the crops to ripen fully. In this way the fruits of the harvest will remain for a long time to be enjoyed by many people. Similarly, if we want to attain the harvest of Buddhahood to benefit countless living beings we need to rely on great compassion at the beginning of our training, throughout our training and at the end of our training.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">At the beginning of our training <a id="calibre_link-316"></a>great compassion is like the seed from which <a id="calibre_link-317"></a>bodhichitta grows, and bodhichitta is like the shoot from which all the realizations of the Mahayana path grow. However, we will not gain these realizations if we do not first develop great compassion, just as we cannot grow crops if we do not first sow the seeds.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Once bodhichitta has grown from the seed of great compassion we enter the <a id="calibre_link-318"></a>Mahayana path and begin to practise the stages of the <a id="calibre_link-319"></a>Bodhisattva’s training. Bodhisattvas need to apply great effort to complete the training in the <a id="calibre_link-320"></a>six perfections and accomplish the ten grounds, and to generate this effort they meditate on great compassion throughout their training. If we do not regularly water plants they will dry up and produce no fruit. In the same way, once we have entered the Mahayana path, if we did not continuously generate great compassion there would be a danger of our bodhichitta deteriorating and not producing perfect results. Therefore, during our training great compassion is like water that sustains growth.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Even after we have attained <a id="calibre_link-321"></a>Buddhahood we still need to rely on great compassion. Without great compassion we would not work continuously for the sake of others and so would not fulfil the purpose of attaining Buddhahood. Therefore, at the end of our training great compassion is like the ripening of the harvest that enables the fruits of Buddhahood to be enjoyed for a long time by countless beings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Whereas when we cultivate external crops the seed, the water for growth and the ripening are all different, in the case of this internal spiritual growth all three functions are performed by great compassion. Therefore, Chandrakirti says that great compassion <span class="italic">itself</span> is like the seed, like water for growth and like ripening for long enjoyment. Because great compassion is so important Chandrakirti begins the <span class="italic">Guide </span>not by praising Hearers, Solitary Realizers, Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, nor by praising the other two causes &ndash; bodhichitta and the wisdom of non-duality &ndash; but by directly praising the mind of great compassion from which they all arise.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">What can we learn from this verse? In his commentary, <a id="calibre_link-322"></a>Je Tsongkhapa says that it clearly demonstrates that the principal practice of <a id="calibre_link-323"></a>Mahayanists is to cultivate the mind of great compassion. If we wish to be sincere Mahayana practitioners we should take this advice to heart and strive to generate this precious mind. Then, on the basis of great compassion we should generate spontaneous bodhichitta and go on to complete all the trainings of a Bodhisattva, especially the perfection of wisdom. In this way we will eventually attain the perfect state of Buddhahood.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">A HOMAGE TO GREAT COMPASSION DISTINGUISHING ITS TYPES</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">In the next six lines Chandrakirti continues his praise of <a id="calibre_link-324"></a><a id="calibre_link-325"></a><a id="calibre_link-326"></a>great compassion by distinguishing three different types &ndash; compassion observing mere living beings, compassion observing phenomena and compassion observing the unobservable. All three types of compassion observe living beings and wish to protect them from suffering. The difference is that the first observes mere living beings without considering their impermanence or emptiness, the second observes living beings who are realized as impermanent and the third observes living beings who are realized as empty of inherent existence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Compassion observing phenomena is a compassion that is induced and accompanied by a realization that all living beings are impermanent. It is so called because it observes living beings who are imputed on the <a id="calibre_link-327"></a>impermanent phenomena of the five <a id="calibre_link-328"></a><a id="calibre_link-329"></a><a id="calibre_link-330"></a>aggregates &ndash; the aggregates of form, feeling, discrimination, compositional factors and consciousness. The compassion itself does not realize that living beings are impermanent, it simply observes living beings who are realized as impermanent and wishes to protect them from suffering.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Compassion observing the unobservable is a compassion that is induced and accompanied by a realization that all living beings lack inherent existence. Lack of inherent existence, or <a id="calibre_link-331"></a>emptiness, is called ‘unobservable’ because it cannot be observed by ordinary minds. Again, the compassion itself does not realize that living beings lack inherent existence, it simply observes living beings who are realized as empty of inherent existence and wishes to protect them from suffering.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">These different types of compassion will now be explained under the following two headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	A homage to compassion observing mere living beings</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	A homage to compassion observing phenomena and the unobservable</p>
			<p class="text-heading">A HOMAGE TO COMPASSION OBSERVING MERE LIVING BEINGS</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.3] I bow down to that compassion for living beings</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Are without self-control like the spinning of a well.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">In this verse Chandrakirti shows how to cultivate <a id="calibre_link-332"></a>compassion in meditation. Since these instructions are very important and must be understood clearly they will be presented extensively under the following four headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	What causes living beings to wander in samsara</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	How living beings wander in samsara</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">3	How living beings experience suffering in samsara</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">4	Generating compassion by contemplating these points</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WHAT CAUSES LIVING BEINGS TO WANDER IN SAMSARA</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Chandrakirti explains that the three principal causes of rebirth in samsara are the view of the transitory collection conceiving I, the view of the transitory collection conceiving mine, and attachment. The <a id="calibre_link-333"></a>view of the transitory collection conceiving I is a type of self-grasping of persons that grasps one’s own I as being an inherently existent I. In dependence on this we generate the <a id="calibre_link-334"></a>view of the transitory collection conceiving mine with respect to our body, possessions, relatives and so forth. Both these views are the same in that they observe one’s own I and conceive it to be inherently existent, but they differ in that the first observes only the I whereas the second observes both I and mine. These views will be explained in more detail later on. For the time being it is sufficient to know that the view of the transitory collection conceiving I arises first and then gives rise to the view of the transitory collection conceiving mine.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Due to their strong sense of I and mine, living beings generate <a id="calibre_link-335"></a>attachment for things that please them and hatred for things that displease them. These two minds in turn lead to all the other delusions such as miserliness, jealousy and pride. Acting under the sway of these <a id="calibre_link-336"></a>delusions, living beings create the <a id="calibre_link-337"></a>karma that causes them to take <a id="calibre_link-338"></a>rebirth in <a id="calibre_link-339"></a><a id="calibre_link-340"></a>samsara and experience <a id="calibre_link-341"></a>suffering.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">HOW LIVING BEINGS WANDER IN SAMSARA</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Living beings have no control over their <a id="calibre_link-342"></a>rebirths in samsara. If they were free to choose they would not take rebirths in which they had to experience miseries such as <a id="calibre_link-343"></a>sickness, ageing and death but would choose rebirths in which they experienced only happiness and comfort. No one wants to suffer but everyone suffers without choice. No one wants to experience dissatisfaction but everyone experiences it without choice. No one wants to be sick but everyone falls ill without choice. No one wants to grow old but everyone ages without choice. No one wants to die but everyone dies without choice. No one wants to wander in samsara, but everyone does so without choice. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Regardless of status, nationality or gender, all living beings have to suffer without choice. Each rebirth they take inevitably ends in an uncontrolled death. However high they rise within one life they eventually fall to lower states. However many possessions they acquire they necessarily lose them all. Whatever relationships they form inevitably end in separation. The cruelty of samsara is such that in all these matters living beings are completely without choice. If we reflect deeply on this point alone we will develop strong compassion for all living beings. If in addition we think about the specific <a id="calibre_link-344"></a>sufferings that they constantly experience, our compassion will grow even stronger.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">We may wonder why it is necessary to think about suffering. The reason is that meditation on suffering is the only way to generate a motivation that will lead us into spiritual paths. By repeatedly meditating on our own suffering we develop a strong wish to escape from samsara. This wish is <a id="calibre_link-345"></a>renunciation, which is the gateway to all spiritual paths. If we then contemplate the suffering of others we naturally develop compassion, which is the gateway to all Mahayana paths.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">To help us to contemplate the suffering of others, Chandrakirti introduces the <a id="calibre_link-346"></a>analogy of the mechanism of a <a id="calibre_link-347"></a>well. The plight of living beings in samsara has six points of similarity with the mechanism of a well:</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">(1) Just as a bucket is bound to the windlass by rope, so living beings are bound to samsara by delusion and karma.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">(2) Just as a windlass is forced to rotate by its operator, so living beings are forced to wander in samsara by their unpeaceful and untamed minds.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">(3) Just as one turn of a windlass is immediately followed by another, so one rebirth in samsara is immediately followed by another.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">(4) Just as a bucket tumbles to the bottom of a well with great ease but is drawn up again only with much effort, so living beings readily migrate to <a id="calibre_link-348"></a>lower rebirths but rise from them only with great difficulty.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">(5) Just as when a windlass is spinning quickly it is difficult to identify where one rotation ends and the next begins, so as living beings wander in samsara it is impossible to tell which comes first &ndash; delusions, actions, or effects. Living beings wander in samsara in dependence on the <a id="calibre_link-349"></a>twelve dependent-related links. Within these there are three that are delusions, two that are actions and seven that are effects. The three delusions are dependent-related ignorance, dependent-related craving and dependent-related grasping. The two actions are dependent-related compositional actions and dependent-related existence. The seven effects are dependent-related consciousness, dependent-related name and form, dependent-related six sources, dependent-related contact, dependent-related feeling, dependent-related birth and dependent-related ageing and death. The three delusions cause the two actions, which produce the seven effects, which in turn lead to the three delusions and so on. In this way, the twelve links revolve unceasingly and it is impossible to say which comes first. For example, we may feel that the delusion ignorance must come first but there can only be ignorance if there has been birth, there can only be birth if there has been action, there can only be action if there has been ignorance and so on.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">HOW LIVING BEINGS EXPERIENCE SUFFERING IN SAMSARA</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">(6) Living beings wander in samsara in much the same way as a bucket moves up and down in a well. As a bucket repeatedly tumbles to the bottom and is drawn up again it swings uncontrollably and is battered, dented and scratched by the sides of the well. In the same way, as living beings roam <a id="calibre_link-350"></a>uncontrollably from the highest heaven to the deepest <a id="calibre_link-351"></a>hell they are constantly battered by the three sufferings, the six sufferings and so forth. These different types of suffering are explained in detail in the book <a id="calibre_link-352"></a><span class="italic">Joyful Path of Good Fortune</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">GENERATING COMPASSION BY CONTEMPLATING THESE POINTS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">If we meditate repeatedly on this verse with the help of the six-fold analogy we will come to see how all living beings are wandering in samsara without control, bound by the twelve dependent-related links and constantly battered by the different types of suffering. In this way we will gradually develop the first type of compassion, compassion observing mere living beings. Because this mind is so precious Chandrakirti pays homage to it saying, ‘I bow down to that compassion’.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">All three types of compassion &ndash; <a id="calibre_link-355"></a>compassion observing mere living beings, compassion observing phenomena, and compassion observing the unobservable &ndash; can be causes of a <a id="calibre_link-356"></a>Bodhisattva because Mahayana trainees with sharp faculties realize both impermanence and emptiness before generating <a id="calibre_link-357"></a>bodhichitta and becoming Bodhisattvas.</p>

The definition of spiritual ground is a clear realization that acts as the foundation of many good qualities. The definition of spiritual path is an exalted awareness conjoined with spontaneous renunciation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">As already explained, renunciation is a strong wish to escape from samsara. To develop renunciation we meditate repeatedly on the faults of samsara and generate a strong wish to escape.

			<p class="text-2nd-para">As the definition implies, spiritual grounds are so called because they serve as the basis for the development of further good qualities, just as the external ground serves as the basis for the growth of crops and so forth. For example, the spiritual ground of the path of accumulation is the basis for all the good qualities of the path of preparation, the spiritual ground of the path of preparation is the basis for all the good qualities of the path of seeing and so on.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are two types of ground &ndash; <a id="calibre_link-367"></a>Hinayana grounds and <a id="calibre_link-368"></a><a id="calibre_link-369"></a>Mahayana grounds. The five <a id="calibre_link-370"></a>Hinayana paths and the five <a id="calibre_link-371"></a>Mahayana paths are all grounds. In both cases the paths of accumulation and preparation are ordinary grounds and the paths of seeing, meditation and No More Learning are superior grounds. The definition of <a id="calibre_link-372"></a>Mahayana path of accumulation is a realization of a Bodhisattva who principally accumulates a collection of merit that is a method for attaining the Mahayana path of preparation. The definition of <a id="calibre_link-373"></a>Mahayana path of preparation is a realization of a Bodhisattva who has attained superior seeing observing emptiness that serves as the preparation for attaining the Mahayana path of seeing. The definition of <a id="calibre_link-374"></a>Mahayana path of seeing is a realization of a Bodhisattva who sees emptiness directly that is a method for attaining the Mahayana path of meditation. The definition of <a id="calibre_link-375"></a>Mahayana path of meditation is a realization of a Superior Bodhisattva who is either abandoning or has abandoned innate true-grasping by practising meditation. The definition of <a id="calibre_link-376"></a>Mahayana Path of No More Learning is an ultimate realization that has abandoned completely the two obstructions. As already explained, Chandrakirti gives a brief account of ordinary Mahayana grounds when he explains the three Dharmas of the expression of worship. The rest of the <span class="italic">Guide</span> explains mainly Mahayana grounds and in particular superior Mahayana grounds.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">There are two types of superior <a id="calibre_link-377"></a>Mahayana ground &ndash; causal grounds and <a id="calibre_link-378"></a>resultant grounds. Causal grounds are grounds that cause the attainment of Buddhahood and resultant grounds are actual Buddha grounds. Superior Mahayana grounds will now be presented extensively under the following two headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	A presentation of causal grounds</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	A presentation of resultant grounds</p>
			<p class="text-heading">A PRESENTATION OF CAUSAL GROUNDS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">There are two types of causal ground &ndash; conventional <a id="calibre_link-379"></a>causal grounds and ultimate <a id="calibre_link-380"></a>causal grounds. Of these, <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> principally explains the latter. The definition of an ultimate causal ground is an <a id="calibre_link-381"></a>uncontaminated mind of a <a id="calibre_link-382"></a>Superior Bodhisattva in single-pointed meditative equipoise on emptiness that is maintained by great compassion. In his <a id="calibre_link-383"></a><span class="italic">Autocommentary</span> Chandrakirti explains that uncontaminated minds are minds that are not polluted by either the ignorance of <a id="calibre_link-384"></a>true-grasping or its imprints. This explanation is according to the Madhyamika-Prasangika view and is quite different from that given by proponents of the lower Buddhist tenets. According to the Madhyamika-Prasangika system, uncontaminated minds exist only in Buddhas and in other <a id="calibre_link-385"></a>Superior beings in meditative equipoise on emptiness. Ordinary beings never have uncontaminated minds because all their minds are polluted by either the ignorance of true-grasping or its imprints. Whatever <a id="calibre_link-386"></a>appears to the mind of an <a id="calibre_link-387"></a>ordinary being appears as truly existent.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Both Hinayana and <a id="calibre_link-388"></a>Mahayana Superiors have uncontaminated minds, but in the case of <a id="calibre_link-389"></a>Hinayanists these minds are not ultimate grounds because they are not maintained by great compassion. The <a id="calibre_link-390"></a>exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of a Superior Bodhisattva in single-pointed meditation on emptiness, however, is both an uncontaminated mind and an ultimate ground. Ultimate ground, <a id="calibre_link-391"></a>ultimate bodhichitta and <a id="calibre_link-392"></a>ultimate mind generation are synonyms.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">As soon as a Superior Bodhisattva rises from meditation and engages in the activities of subsequent attainment all his or her minds become <a id="calibre_link-393"></a>contaminated minds and so they are no longer ultimate grounds. This is because all minds of <a id="calibre_link-394"></a><a id="calibre_link-395"></a>subsequent attainment in all beings other than Buddhas are polluted by either the ignorance of true-grasping or its imprints. When a Bodhisattva reaches the <a id="calibre_link-396"></a>eighth ground he completely abandons true-grasping, but his minds of <a id="calibre_link-397"></a>subsequent attainment remain polluted by the <a id="calibre_link-398"></a><a id="calibre_link-399"></a>imprints of true-grasping. These cause phenomena to appear as truly existent even though the Bodhisattva no longer assents to that appearance. These imprints, which are known as ‘<a id="calibre_link-400"></a>obstructions to omniscience’, are not abandoned until <a id="calibre_link-401"></a>Buddhahood is attained. Thus, only a <a id="calibre_link-402"></a>Buddha is completely free from contaminated minds. A Buddha never conceives phenomena to be truly existent and they never appear to him or her to be so.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are ten ultimate causal grounds, which are known as Very Joyful, Stainless, Luminous, Radiant, Difficult to Overcome, Approaching, Gone Afar, Immovable, Good Intelligence and Cloud of Dharma. Because these ultimate grounds are all <a id="calibre_link-403"></a>exalted awarenesses of meditative equipoise mixed with emptiness they cannot be distinguished from the point of view of their nature. For example, if ten birds fly across the sky all they leave behind is empty space, and so their individual trails cannot be distinguished. However, ten grounds can be distinguished from the point of view of their good qualities, powers, surpassing perfections and modes of taking rebirth. These will be explained in more detail below.</p>

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Explanation of the first ground</p>

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">4	Etymology of the first ground</p>
			<p class="text-heading">HOW THE FIRST GROUND IS ATTAINED</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">As explained previously, a Mahayana trainee trains in the <a id="calibre_link-406"></a>three Dharmas &ndash; great compassion, the wisdom of non-duality associated with bodhichitta, and bodhichitta &ndash; until he or she generates spontaneous <a id="calibre_link-407"></a>bodhichitta. The moment he generates spontaneous bodhichitta he enters the <a id="calibre_link-408"></a>Mahayana path of accumulation and becomes a Bodhisattva of the path of accumulation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">While on the path of accumulation the Bodhisattva meditates on emptiness with a concentration of tranquil abiding until he or she attains the realization of <a id="calibre_link-409"></a>superior seeing observing emptiness. With the attainment of the union of <a id="calibre_link-410"></a>tranquil abiding and superior seeing he advances to the path of preparation and becomes a Bodhisattva of the <a id="calibre_link-411"></a>path of preparation. At this stage the Bodhisattva’s meditation on <a id="calibre_link-412"></a>emptiness is still conceptual, that is emptiness still appears to his mind mixed with a <a id="calibre_link-413"></a>generic image. Because of this he still has dualistic appearance.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">To remove the generic image and overcome <a id="calibre_link-414"></a>dualistic appearance he or she meditates repeatedly on emptiness with a union of tranquil abiding and superior seeing. Through the force of this meditation the generic image gradually fades until it disappears altogether and emptiness appears clearly and directly to his mind. All dualistic appearance subsides into emptiness and his mind mixes with emptiness like water mixing with water. He now has a non-conceptual <a id="calibre_link-415"></a>realization of emptiness. With this attainment, which is ultimate bodhichitta, he enters the <a id="calibre_link-416"></a>Mahayana path of seeing and attains the first ground. He is now a <a id="calibre_link-417"></a>Superior Bodhisattva of the first ground. Bodhisattvas on the paths of accumulation and preparation are called ‘ordinary <a id="calibre_link-418"></a>Bodhisattvas’ because they have not attained ultimate bodhichitta and Bodhisattvas on the paths of seeing and meditation are called ‘Superior Bodhisattvas’ because they have attained <a id="calibre_link-419"></a>ultimate bodhichitta.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The first moment of the non-conceptual wisdom directly realizing emptiness is the uninterrupted path of the path of seeing. This mind functions as the direct antidote to <a id="calibre_link-420"></a>intellectually-formed <a id="calibre_link-421"></a>true-grasping and its seeds. It is called an ‘<a id="calibre_link-422"></a>uninterrupted path’ because the Bodhisattva passes without interruption into the <a id="calibre_link-423"></a>released path of the first ground, which is a mind that has completely abandoned intellectually-formed true-grasping and its seeds. Thus in one meditation session the Bodhisattva passes from the last moment of the <a id="calibre_link-424"></a>path of preparation through the <a id="calibre_link-425"></a>uninterrupted path of the path of seeing to the released path of the first ground. He then rises from meditation and, knowing that he has abandoned intellectually-formed true-grasping, engages in the practices of <a id="calibre_link-426"></a>subsequent attainment of the first ground.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DEFINITION OF THE FIRST GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of the <a id="calibre_link-427"></a>first ground is a Superior Bodhisattva’s path that abandons or has abandoned intellectually-formed true-grasping, its principal object of abandonment, and that has attained a surpassing practice of the perfection of giving from within the ten perfections.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS OF THE FIRST GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The first ground has two divisions &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-428"></a>path of seeing and the <a id="calibre_link-429"></a>path of meditation of the first ground. The first has three divisions &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-430"></a>exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the path of seeing, the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment of the path of seeing and the exalted awareness of the path of seeing that is neither of the two. The exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the path of seeing has three divisions &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-431"></a>uninterrupted path of the path of seeing, the released path of the first ground and the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the path of seeing that is neither of the two. The definition of the first is the exalted awareness of the first ground that functions as the direct antidote to intellectually-formed true-grasping. The definition of the second is the exalted awareness of the first ground that occurs in the same session as the <a id="calibre_link-432"></a>uninterrupted path of the path of seeing and that has abandoned intellectually-formed true-grasping. The definition of the third is an exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the path of seeing that is neither an uninterrupted path nor a released path.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The <a id="calibre_link-433"></a>exalted awareness of <a id="calibre_link-434"></a>subsequent attainment of the path of seeing is any manifest path in the continuum of a Bodhisattva on the path of seeing who is not in meditative equipoise. It first manifests after the released path of the first ground has ceased. The <a id="calibre_link-435"></a>exalted awareness of the path of seeing that is neither of the two is any non-manifest path in the continuum of a Bodhisattva on the path of seeing, for example, his realization of great compassion at the time of meditative equipoise.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The definition of the path of meditation of the first ground is the exalted awareness of the first ground that functions as the direct antidote to big-big innate true-grasping. The path of meditation of the first ground is necessarily an uninterrupted path and lasts for only one session. Thus, there are two uninterrupted paths on the first ground &ndash; the uninterrupted path of the path of seeing, which occurs at the very beginning, and the uninterrupted path of the path of meditation of the first ground, which occurs at the very end. However, there is only one released path on the first ground.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ETYMOLOGY OF THE FIRST GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">When a Bodhisattva attains the <a id="calibre_link-436"></a>first ground he sees that he is now very close to attaining full enlightenment and will soon be able to fulfil the welfare of all living beings. This gives rise to an experience of extraordinary joy. Therefore the first ground is called ‘Very Joyful’.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">EXPLANATION OF THE FIRST GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The first ground will now be explained extensively under the following three headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Briefly showing the entity of the ground, the basis of characteristics</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of the <a id="calibre_link-438"></a>first ultimate <a id="calibre_link-439"></a>ground is an uncontaminated mind of a Bodhisattva on the first ground. The Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-440"></a>first ground possesses three attributes &ndash; his mind is governed by a great compassion that wishes to liberate all living beings from samsara, all his roots of virtue are dedicated to the attainment of full enlightenment with aspirational prayers similar to those of the Bodhisattva <a id="calibre_link-441"></a>Samantabhadra and he always abides in great joy. The first ground is also called the ‘first <a id="calibre_link-442"></a>supramundane mind’.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">These lines reveal eight special good qualities of the first-ground Bodhisattva, which will now be explained.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITY OF ATTAINING A MEANINGFUL NAME</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">When a Bodhisattva reaches the first ground he or she attains an ultimate mind for the first time and from then on is known as an ‘ultimate <a id="calibre_link-444"></a>Bodhisattva’.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITY OF BIRTH INTO BUDDHA’S FAMILY</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">When a Bodhisattva generates ultimate <a id="calibre_link-445"></a>bodhichitta and attains the first ground he or she becomes a member of Buddha’s family.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> In <a id="calibre_link-446"></a><span class="italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span> Shantideva says that we become a member of Buddha’s family when we generate conventional bodhichitta. He says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Today I am born into the <a id="calibre_link-447"></a>lineage of Buddha</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">And have become a Bodhisattva.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Why does Chandrakirti say we become a member of Buddha’s family when we generate ultimate bodhichitta?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> We can understand the difference between these two explanations by considering the following example. All the sons of a <a id="calibre_link-448"></a><a id="calibre_link-449"></a>king are members of his family, but the son who is the immediate heir and about to become a king himself is a special member of the family. In the same way, when we generate conventional bodhichitta we become a member of Buddha’s family, but when we generate ultimate bodhichitta and attain the first ground we are very close to becoming a Buddha and so we become a special member of Buddha’s family.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITY OF ABANDONING THE <a id="calibre_link-450"></a>THREE BONDS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Delusions such as attachment and ignorance are sometimes called ‘bonds’ because they bind us tightly to samsara. The three bonds referred to here are the intellectually-formed <a id="calibre_link-451"></a>view of the transitory collection, <a id="calibre_link-452"></a>deluded doubt, and <a id="calibre_link-453"></a>holding wrong moral disciplines and conduct as supreme. These are all <a id="calibre_link-454"></a>intellectually-formed delusions and Bodhisattvas abandon these along with all the other intellectually-formed delusions on the first ground.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The view of the transitory collection is of two types &ndash; the intellectually-formed view of the transitory collection and the innate <a id="calibre_link-455"></a>view of the transitory collection. We develop the intellectually-formed view of the transitory collection when we speculate about the nature of our I and conclude that it is inherently existent. This delusion exists in the continuum of all proponents of tenets who assert an inherently existent I, including those who adhere to the views of any of the Buddhist schools below the Madhyamika-Prasangika school. However, it is not unique to proponents of tenets. If anyone as a result of relying on mistaken reasoning or misguided advice holds their I to be inherently existent they possess this view. Ordinary human beings who do not investigate the nature of their I, and other beings such as <a id="calibre_link-456"></a>animals and insects never generate it.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The innate view of the transitory collection is a mind conceiving one’s own I to be inherently existent that arises naturally without any intellectual investigation from imprints accumulated in the mind over countless lives. Unlike the intellectually-formed view, it functions continuously in the minds of all ordinary beings including animals and insects. The innate view of the transitory collection is the root of <a id="calibre_link-457"></a>samsara. It is not abandoned by Hinayanists until they become Foe Destroyers or by Mahayanists until they become eighth-ground Bodhisattvas. The intellectually-formed view of the transitory collection, however, is abandoned by Hinayanists on the path of seeing and by Mahayanists on the first ground.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-458"></a>Deluded doubts are doubts that impede our spiritual progress. For example, as a result of gaining some understanding of Dharma we might have a peaceful mind and be content with our practice, applying steady effort and making gradual progress, but if we encounter someone who through clever argument shakes our confidence and causes us to doubt what we had previously accepted, our peace of mind will be disturbed, our effort will decrease and our practice will be disrupted. Doubts such as these are deluded doubts because they rob us of our positive minds.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Not all doubts are deluded doubts. In some cases doubt can be a virtuous state of mind that assists our spiritual development. When we hear teachings on emptiness, for example, we may generate many doubts but these often compel us to probe more deeply into the subject and so help to improve our understanding. We should consider ourself fortunate to have such doubts for there are many living beings who never even doubt emptiness let alone realize it.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-459"></a>third bond arises when, as a result of following misguided teachers or adhering to mistaken beliefs, we come to regard certain wrong practices as beneficial and consider them to be superior to other practices. For example, some people believe that a spiritual life entails going around naked or simply wearing an animal’s skin, some claim that since we create many negative actions when we are busy spiritual practitioners should remain idle like dogs, some believe that repeated washing purifies negative actions, some regard jumping into fires as a spiritual practice, some consider it a commitment of their deity to kill goats, sheep and chickens and to sacrifice their blood, regarding these practices as pure moral discipline, and some engage in sexual misconduct believing they are practising <a id="calibre_link-460"></a>Secret Mantra. Minds that cling to such practices as being beneficial and superior to other practices are intellectually-formed delusions. They are generated only as a result of following misguided instructions and advice or relying on mistaken reasoning; they never arise naturally.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> There are many other intellectually-formed delusions such as intellectually-formed attachment and intellectually-formed anger that are abandoned on the first ground. Why does Chandrakirti mention only these three here?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> The three bonds are mentioned separately because they are the principal impediments to attaining <a id="calibre_link-461"></a>liberation or <a id="calibre_link-462"></a>enlightenment. If we want to travel to a foreign country, for example, our journey will be impeded if we lose the wish to go, if we have doubts about the correct route or if we take the wrong route. In the same way, our journey to liberation is impeded by the intellectually-formed <a id="calibre_link-463"></a>view of the transitory collection, which strengthens our delusions and diminishes our wish to attain liberation; by <a id="calibre_link-464"></a>deluded doubts, which induce hesitation in our practice and diminish our effort; and by <a id="calibre_link-465"></a>holding wrong moral disciplines and conduct as supreme, which causes us to follow wrong paths. When a Bodhisattva attains the first ground he or she completely abandons the three bonds, together with all other intellectually-formed delusions and their seeds.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITY OF ABIDING IN GREAT JOY</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">As mentioned above, when the Bodhisattva reaches the first ground he or she attains a non-conceptual <a id="calibre_link-466"></a>realization of emptiness. He sees emptiness with his mental awareness as clearly and vividly as he sees something with his eye awareness. This induces a supreme joy that remains with him always. He also abandons all intellectually-formed delusions and attains many special qualities and powers and as a result abides in eternal joy.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITY OF BEING ABLE TO CAUSE A HUNDRED WORLDS TO SHAKE</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Through the force of his realizations the Bodhisattva on the first ground develops many special powers including the ability to cause a hundred different worlds to shake in an instant. This and the other powers developed on each of the grounds will be explained more fully below.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITY OF MASTERING HIGHER GROUNDS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">When he attains the first ground the Bodhisattva experiences great peace and happiness. Even so, he is not content to remain there but motivated by his <a id="calibre_link-467"></a>great compassion longs to advance to higher grounds. If we were to taste the joy of the first ground we would certainly develop attachment to it and lose any wish to exert ourself further. It is much the same with Hinayana <a id="calibre_link-468"></a><a id="calibre_link-469"></a>Foe Destroyers. Although they have no attachment they are nevertheless completely satisfied with the tranquillity they experience and have no wish to advance further. It is a unique quality of Bodhisattvas that even though they experience extraordinary peace and happiness they are moved by their great compassion to advance to higher states.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITY OF DESTROYING THE CAUSES OF LOWER REBIRTH</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The Bodhisattva on the first ground has destroyed the causes of <a id="calibre_link-470"></a>lower rebirth with the antidote of his non-conceptual <a id="calibre_link-471"></a>realization of emptiness. In fact, from the first ground onwards it is impossible for the Bodhisattva to create the cause for any uncontrolled <a id="calibre_link-472"></a>rebirth in samsara, least of all a lower rebirth.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-473"></a>Throwing actions that cause rebirth in samsara are dependent-related compositional actions, the second of the <a id="calibre_link-474"></a><a id="calibre_link-475"></a>twelve dependent-related links. They arise in dependence on the first link, dependent-related ignorance, which is the root of samsara. This is the grossest and most powerful form of self-grasping. When the Bodhisattva attains the first ground the power of his self-grasping is considerably reduced and his dependent-related ignorance ceases altogether. Consequently, the remaining eleven links from dependent-related compositional actions through to dependent-related birth and dependent-related ageing and death also cease. Therefore it is impossible for the first-ground Bodhisattva to take any rebirth caused by karma and delusion. From then on he takes rebirth in the abodes of samsara only out of choice motivated by his <a id="calibre_link-476"></a>great compassion to help other living beings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below"><a id="calibre_link-477"></a>Hinayana Superiors also have a direct realization of emptiness and they too are unable to create the cause for rebirth in samsara. However, there are some who take such rebirths through the force of karma accumulated before becoming Superior beings.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> It is impossible even for a Bodhisattva on the patience stage of the path of preparation to take lower rebirth, so why is this given as a special quality of the first ground?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> The Bodhisattva on the patience stage of the <a id="calibre_link-478"></a>path of preparation is prevented from taking lower rebirth by the power of his or her realizations, which prevent the conditions coming together for the throwing <a id="calibre_link-479"></a>karma to ripen, but the Bodhisattva on the first ground is prevented from taking lower rebirth because he or she has destroyed the causes of such rebirths.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITY OF EXHAUSTING THE GROUNDS OF ORDINARY BEINGS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Once the Bodhisattva attains the first ground he or she becomes a Superior being and passes beyond ordinary grounds. He will never return to the state of an ordinary being.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">SHOWING THE GOOD QUALITIES IN BRIEF</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">[I.7d] He is shown to be similar to an eighth Superior.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Chandrakirti summarizes the good qualities of a <a id="calibre_link-480"></a>first-ground Bodhisattva by comparing him or her to an eighth Superior of the <a id="calibre_link-481"></a>Hinayana. Because the good qualities of Hinayana Superiors are relatively easy to attain they are also easier to understand, and so Chandrakirti uses them to illustrate the good qualities of a Bodhisattva Superior.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">As mentioned before, when Buddha taught the Hinayana path he explained eight levels of <a id="calibre_link-482"></a><a id="calibre_link-483"></a>Hearer Superior from approachers to the accomplishment of a <a id="calibre_link-484"></a>Stream Enterer to abiders in the accomplishment of a Foe Destroyer. This is the order in which the eight types of Hearer Superior are usually explained. Chandrakirti, however, explains them in reverse order, referring to the first Superior, an approacher to the accomplishment of a Stream Enterer, as an ‘<a id="calibre_link-485"></a>eighth Superior’. His meaning is that just as an eighth Hearer Superior has already attained many good qualities and will now go on to accomplish all the good qualities of a Hearer Superior, so the first-ground Bodhisattva has attained many good qualities and will now go on to accomplish all the good qualities of a Mahayana Superior.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This section has three parts:</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Through the power of his greatly increased merit;</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The <a id="calibre_link-487"></a>Bodhisattva on the first ground has good qualities of both wisdom and <a id="calibre_link-488"></a>method. His good qualities of <a id="calibre_link-489"></a>wisdom are his wisdom directly realizing emptiness and so forth, but since Hearer and Solitary Realizer <a id="calibre_link-490"></a><a id="calibre_link-491"></a>Superiors also possess these qualities he does not outshine these other holy beings by way of wisdom. However he does outshine them by way of method. His good qualities of method are his realizations of great compassion, bodhichitta and so forth. In dependence on these a Bodhisattva accumulates a vast collection of merit and enters the uncommon <a id="calibre_link-492"></a>Mahayana lineage. Because Hinayana Superiors do not possess these minds or the great collection of merit that they generate the Bodhisattva on the first ground outshines these other holy beings by way of lineage. Here, the root text refers to Hearer Superiors as ‘those born from the speech of the Powerful Able One’ and to Solitary Realizer Superiors as ‘Solitary Buddhas’.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">In <a id="calibre_link-493"></a><span class="italic">Perfect Liberation of Maitreya Sutra</span> Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-begin">Son of the lineage, it is like this. For example, immediately a prince is born, because he bears the name of a <a id="calibre_link-494"></a><a id="calibre_link-495"></a>king he outshines the entire retinue of elder and principal ministers through the greatness of his lineage. In the same way, immediately a novice Bodhisattva generates the <a id="calibre_link-496"></a>mind of enlightenment, because he is born into the lineage of the <a id="calibre_link-497"></a>Tathagatas he outshines Hearers and Solitary Realizers who have been practising pure deeds for a long time, through the power of his compassion and bodhichitta.</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-last-para">Son of the lineage, it is like this. For example, immediately it is born, the offspring of a <a id="calibre_link-498"></a><a id="calibre_link-499"></a>garuda, the king of birds, possesses good qualities such as strength of wing and complete clarity of vision that other older birds do not possess. In the same way, immediately a Bodhisattva generates the first mind of enlightenment and is born into the great lineage of the Tathagatas he surpasses others through the strength of his wish for omniscience and the complete purity of his superior intention. Even all the Hearers and Solitary Realizers who have been practising renunciation for a hundred thousand aeons do not possess these qualities.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Because this passage refers to a Bodhisattva on the first ground we should understand the phrase ‘novice Bodhisattva’ to mean a Bodhisattva who has newly attained the first ground and references to generating the mind of enlightenment to mean generating the first ultimate mind of enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> Does this mean that Bodhisattvas on the <a id="calibre_link-500"></a><a id="calibre_link-501"></a>paths of accumulation and preparation do not outshine Hinayana Superiors by way of lineage?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> No it does not. These Bodhisattvas also possess uncommon realizations of great compassion and bodhichitta, and so they too outshine Hinayana Superiors by way of lineage.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">OUTSHINING HEARERS AND SOLITARY REALIZERS BY WAY OF WISDOM ON THE SEVENTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">[I.8d] And on Gone Afar he surpasses them in wisdom.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">When a Bodhisattva reaches the <a id="calibre_link-502"></a><a id="calibre_link-503"></a>seventh ground, Gone Afar, he develops a <a id="calibre_link-504"></a>wisdom that is superior to that of Hinayana Superiors, and so he then surpasses them in both merit and wisdom. Some say that the reason a Bodhisattva on the seventh ground surpasses Hinayana Superiors in wisdom is that on this ground he or she is able to abandon <a id="calibre_link-505"></a>obstructions to omniscience for the first time. However, this explanation is not correct because a Bodhisattva on the seventh ground does not abandon obstructions to omniscience. Obstructions to omniscience cannot be abandoned until all the <a id="calibre_link-506"></a>delusion-obstructions have been abandoned, and a Bodhisattva does not abandon all the delusion-obstructions until he or she has reached the <a id="calibre_link-507"></a>eighth ground.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">According to the present system, the Bodhisattva on the seventh ground surpasses Hinayana Superiors in wisdom because he or she possesses a special quick <a id="calibre_link-508"></a>wisdom and special powers of concentration. These enable him to enter into and rise from <a id="calibre_link-509"></a>absorption on the perfect ultimate cessation, or emptiness, in an instant. On the first ground, when the <a id="calibre_link-510"></a>Bodhisattva gains a non-conceptual <a id="calibre_link-511"></a>realization of emptiness for the first time and his mind mixes with emptiness like water mixing with water he finds it difficult to rise quickly from that meditation. By the time he reaches the seventh ground, however, his mind can enter into absorption on emptiness and rise again in the duration of one finger snap. Hinayana Superiors do not possess this quick wisdom.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Bodhisattvas on the <a id="calibre_link-512"></a><a id="calibre_link-513"></a>paths of accumulation and preparation can rise from meditation on emptiness with relative ease because their mind does not mix with emptiness like water mixing with water. Similarly, those at lower levels of practice experience no difficulty in rising quickly from meditation on emptiness! Thus the ability to rise quickly from meditation on emptiness is not in itself a special quality. However, for those who have accomplished complete absorption on emptiness, where the mind mixes with emptiness like water mixing with water, such an ability is a sign of powerful concentration and a special quick wisdom. Because Bodhisattvas on the seventh ground possess these qualities they outshine Hinayana Superiors by way of wisdom.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">AN EXPLANATION OF THE MEANING ESTABLISHED BY THIS TEACHING</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This has three parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The teaching of <span class="italic">Sutra on the Ten Grounds</span> that Hearers and Solitary Realizers have the realization of the <a id="calibre_link-514"></a>lack of inherent existence of all phenomena</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	The sources that prove this</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">3	Rejecting arguments against this teaching</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE TEACHING OF <span class="bold-italic">SUTRA ON THE TEN GROUNDS</span> THAT HEARERS AND SOLITARY REALIZERS HAVE THE REALIZATION OF THE LACK OF INHERENT EXISTENCE OF ALL PHENOMENA</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><a id="calibre_link-515"></a><span class="italic">Sutra on the Ten Grounds</span> and <a id="calibre_link-516"></a><span class="italic">Perfect Liberation of Maitreya </span><span class="italic">Sutra</span> both clearly explain that Bodhisattvas on the first six grounds do not surpass <a id="calibre_link-517"></a>Hearer and <a id="calibre_link-518"></a>Solitary Realizer Superiors in <a id="calibre_link-519"></a>wisdom. This indicates that <a id="calibre_link-520"></a>Hearer and Solitary Realizer <a id="calibre_link-521"></a><a id="calibre_link-522"></a>Superiors have the same wisdom <a id="calibre_link-523"></a>realizations as Bodhisattvas on the first six grounds. Since Bodhisattvas on these grounds realize the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena, it follows that Hearer and Solitary Realizer Superiors also have this realization. Indeed, if they lacked this realization they would have no means of attaining liberation.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para"><span class="italic">Objection</span> According to the teachings of <a id="calibre_link-524"></a><span class="italic">Treasury of </span><span class="italic"><a id="calibre_link-525"></a></span><span class="italic">Abhidharma</span> by Vasubandhu and <a id="calibre_link-526"></a><span class="italic">Compendium of Abhidharma</span> by Asanga, it is possible to attain liberation and become a Foe Destroyer by meditating on the views of the <a id="calibre_link-527"></a>Sautrantika and <a id="calibre_link-528"></a>Chittamatra schools, neither of which asserts lack of inherent existence. Both authors quote Buddha’s Sutras to support this view. They say that in some Sutras Buddha says that by meditating on the selflessness that is the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person it is possible to attain the path of seeing and abandon intellectually-formed self-grasping and all the other intellectually-formed delusions, and that through further acquaintance with this selflessness it is possible to attain the path of meditation, abandon innate delusions and attain <a id="calibre_link-529"></a>liberation as a Foe Destroyer.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Moreover, some Mahayana Sutras explain how to attain liberation by meditating on the view of the Chittamatra school, while others explain how to attain liberation by meditating on the view of the Madhyamika-Svatantrika school. Since none of these schools propounds lack of inherent existence it seems that it is not necessary to realize lack of inherent existence to attain liberation. All these scriptures state quite clearly that to attain liberation it is sufficient to meditate on the selflessness that is the lack of a <a id="calibre_link-530"></a>self-supporting, substantially existent person. Therefore your claim that Hearers and Solitary Realizers would not be able to attain liberation if they lacked the realization of the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena contradicts these scriptures.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para"><span class="italic">Reply</span> It is true that these scriptures explain how to attain liberation in dependence on the views of the lower schools. However, Buddha gave these teachings for the benefit of disciples who were unable to realize the subtle view of the Madhyamika-Prasangika school; they do not reveal his final intention. Since these teachings were given according to the capacities of the disciples rather than Buddha’s final intention they are teachings requiring <a id="calibre_link-531"></a>interpretation, not teachings of <a id="calibre_link-532"></a>definitive meaning.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In those Sutras referred to by the authors of the two <a id="calibre_link-533"></a><span class="italic">Abhidharmas</span>, where Buddha spoke of a path of seeing, a <a id="calibre_link-534"></a>path of meditation and liberation, he was not referring to actual <a id="calibre_link-535"></a>paths of seeing and so on. These are explained only in Sutras that reveal Buddha’s final intention, such as <a id="calibre_link-536"></a><span class="italic">Sutra on the Ten Grounds</span> and <a id="calibre_link-537"></a><span class="italic">Perfect Liberation of Maitreya Sutra</span>. According to these Sutras we can attain the path of seeing and so on only by realizing lack of inherent existence. These Sutras clearly state that all <a id="calibre_link-538"></a>Superior beings and all Foe Destroyers realize lack of inherent existence. Thus the meaning of this present teaching is that it is definitely not possible to attain liberation by relying on the views of the lower schools, and that those who have a sincere wish to attain <a id="calibre_link-539"></a>liberation should strive to realize the lack of inherent existence revealed by the glorious <a id="calibre_link-540"></a>Madhyamika-Prasangika school.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">This is also the intention of the great Bodhisattva, Shantideva. In <a id="calibre_link-541"></a><span class="italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span> he says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">... the scriptures explain that without the path of wisdom realizing this emptiness,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">It is impossible to attain even the small enlightenment of self-liberation.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">This means that without the spiritual path that realizes the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena it is impossible to attain the enlightenment of a Hearer, a Solitary Realizer, or a Buddha.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The self-grasping explained in the two <span class="italic">Abhidharmas</span>, grasping at a self-supporting, substantially existent person, is not actual self-grasping and so by abandoning it we do not attain actual liberation. Grasping at a self-supporting, substantially existent person is gross <a id="calibre_link-542"></a>self-grasping and the delusions that arise in dependence on it are gross <a id="calibre_link-543"></a>delusions. Actual self-grasping is the subtle <a id="calibre_link-544"></a>self-grasping conceiving an inherently existent self. This is the root of all other delusions and therefore the root of samsara. Since the two <a id="calibre_link-545"></a><span class="italic">Abhidharmas</span> do not explain this self-grasping or the delusions that arise from it those who follow these systems do not strive to abandon them. Therefore, they cannot abandon all delusions and attain liberation. The most they can achieve is a temporary abandonment of the delusions explained in those texts &ndash; the gross delusions &ndash; and a temporary abandonment of gross delusions is not a state of liberation. Actual liberation is permanent freedom from all delusions, including grasping at an inherently existent self and the delusions that arise in dependence on it. The only way to attain this liberation is by realizing <a id="calibre_link-546"></a>lack of inherent existence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Moreover, to abandon subtle self-grasping of persons and attain liberation we need to abandon not only grasping at an inherently existent self but also grasping at inherently existent <a id="calibre_link-547"></a>aggregates. Thus we need to realize the lack of inherent existence of both persons and phenomena other than persons. In other words we must realize the lack of inherent existence of <span class="italic">all</span> phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE SOURCES THAT PROVE THIS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This has two parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Mahayana Sutras that prove this</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Treatises and Hinayana Sutras that prove this</p>
			<p class="text-heading">MAHAYANA SUTRAS THAT PROVE THIS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">There are many <a id="calibre_link-548"></a>Mahayana Sutras that establish that Hinayana Superiors realize lack of inherent existence. One most commonly quoted is <a id="calibre_link-549"></a><span class="italic">Sutra Requested by those with Superior Intention</span>, in which Buddha gives the <a id="calibre_link-550"></a>analogy of a man attending a magician’s performance. The <a id="calibre_link-551"></a>magician creates an illusion of a woman and the man on seeing her develops strong <a id="calibre_link-552"></a>attachment. With his mind ensnared by attachment he becomes anxious and embarrassed in the company of his friends. To overcome his attachment he leaves his seat and goes off to contemplate the unattractiveness, <a id="calibre_link-553"></a>impermanence, suffering, emptiness and selflessness of the woman. ‘What do you think,’ asks Buddha, ‘Is that man behaving correctly or incorrectly?’ His disciples reply that anyone who strives to realize the unattractiveness and so forth of a non-existent woman is obviously behaving incorrectly. Buddha continues, ‘You should view similarly those monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who consider unproduced and unarisen phenomena to be unattractive, impermanent, suffering, empty and selfless. I do not say that these misguided people are meditating on the path, for they are practising incorrectly.’</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">In this analogy the man sees the magician’s creation as a real woman and then goes off to contemplate her impermanence and so forth. This is similar to those practitioners, including the proponents of the lower schools of tenets, who hold the <a id="calibre_link-554"></a>four noble truths to be inherently existent and then meditate on their aspects such as impermanence and so forth. Buddha says that they are not meditating correctly. Such a mind is a wrong awareness and therefore not a path to liberation. Thus, this Sutra clearly explains that to attain liberation it is necessary to realize the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena, including the <a id="calibre_link-555"></a>four noble truths.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> Since all proponents of lower tenets believe phenomena to be inherently existent does this mean that they cannot meditate correctly? For example, because <a id="calibre_link-556"></a>Chittamatrins believe the <a id="calibre_link-557"></a>body to be <a id="calibre_link-558"></a>inherently existent it would seem that whenever they meditate on the impermanence of the body they are meditating incorrectly like the man in the analogy.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para"><span class="italic">Answer</span> This is not necessarily the case. If a Chittamatrin conceives his or her body to be inherently existent and then meditates on its impermanence, he or she is obviously meditating incorrectly. However, if he simply focuses on the mere body without considering whether it is inherently existent and then meditates on its impermanence, his meditation is perfectly correct.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-559"></a>Ordinary beings apprehend objects in two ways &ndash; one mind apprehending the mere object and another apprehending the object as inherently existent. For example, when we apprehend our body there is one mind apprehending the mere body and another apprehending an inherently existent body. The first is a <a id="calibre_link-560"></a>valid cognizer and the second a <a id="calibre_link-561"></a>self-grasping mind and wrong awareness. Usually, these two modes of apprehension function simultaneously and until we have some experience of emptiness we cannot distinguish them clearly.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The problem with the man in the analogy is that he holds the woman to be a real woman and tries to contemplate her impermanence and so on. Had he simply observed the mere woman created by the magician and then meditated on her impermanence his meditation would not have been mistaken. Thus, proponents of lower tenets such as the Chittamatrins are capable of correct meditation. This is obviously the case because <a id="calibre_link-562"></a>Atisha’s great Teacher Lama <a id="calibre_link-563"></a>Serlingpa was a Chittamatrin who realized bodhichitta, and he could not have gained this realization by aspiring to become an inherently existent Buddha!</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">However, although it is possible to meditate correctly on impermanence and so forth by relying on the views of the lower schools it is not possible to attain liberation by relying on these views. This is because the lower schools do not assert the lack of inherent existence of phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">It is not only this Sutra that teaches that liberation is impossible without a realization of the lack of inherent existence of phenomena. The same point is made in many other Mahayana Sutras, including the <a id="calibre_link-564"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span> and <a id="calibre_link-565"></a><span class="italic">Vajra Cutting Sutra</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">TREATISES AND HINAYANA SUTRAS THAT PROVE THIS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The need to realize lack of inherent existence is established not only in the Mahayana Sutras but also in various <a id="calibre_link-566"></a>treatises and in Hinayana Sutras. As an example of the first, Chandrakirti cites <a id="calibre_link-567"></a><span class="italic">Precious Garland</span>, where Nagarjuna says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">As long as there is grasping at the aggregates</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">There is grasping at I,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">And wherever there is grasping at I</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">There is karma and rebirth.</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">With these three paths in mutual causation,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Without beginning, middle or end,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">The wheel of samsara</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Turns like a spinning firebrand.</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Because this is not obtained</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">From self, other, or both in any of the three times</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Grasping at self is extinguished</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">And with it karma and rebirth.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The meaning of the first verse is that for as long as we grasp at inherently existent <a id="calibre_link-568"></a>aggregates we also grasp at an inherently existent I. Due to this <a id="calibre_link-569"></a><a id="calibre_link-570"></a>self-grasping we create karma that causes <a id="calibre_link-571"></a>rebirth in <a id="calibre_link-572"></a>samsara. This shows that the minds conceiving an inherently existent I and inherently existent aggregates are the root of samsara and that if we want to attain liberation we must abandon both of them. Since Hearers and Solitary Realizers do attain liberation it follows that they abandon these minds, and they can do this only by realizing the lack of inherent existence of both the I and the aggregates.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The second verse explains how living beings wander in samsara in dependence on the three paths of <a id="calibre_link-573"></a>delusion, <a id="calibre_link-574"></a>karma and rebirth. Under the influence of delusions they create the karma to take rebirth in <a id="calibre_link-575"></a>samsara. In each rebirth they generate more delusions, which cause them to create more karma to take more rebirths, and so on. With each one causing the other, these three circle in mutual causation without beginning, middle or end. If we twirl a lighted incense stick we create an apparently uninterrupted circle of light. In the same way, in dependence on the mutual causation of delusion, karma and rebirth living beings revolve in samsara without break.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The third verse shows that the only way to break this vicious circle is to realize the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena. Once we have extinguished grasping at an inherently existent self all our delusions cease and we no longer create the karma that causes rebirth in samsara. Without realizing the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena, however, it is impossible to stop taking samsaric rebirth and become a <a id="calibre_link-576"></a>Foe Destroyer.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Buddha also teaches the need to realize lack of inherent existence in <a id="calibre_link-577"></a>Hinayana Sutras. In <a id="calibre_link-578"></a><span class="italic">Sutra Expounded to Hearers</span>, for example, Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Forms are like bursting balls of foam,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Feelings are like bubbles of water,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Discriminations are like mirages,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Compositional factors are like plantain trees,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Consciousnesses are like magical illusions.</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Thus the Friend of the Sun [Buddha] says.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The first line teaches that the <a id="calibre_link-579"></a><a id="calibre_link-580"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-581"></a>form lacks <a id="calibre_link-582"></a>inherent existence by comparing it to a bursting ball of foam. A ball of foam may appear substantial but when it bursts it disappears into empty space. Similarly, forms such as the <a id="calibre_link-583"></a>body appear to be substantial entities, but their ultimate nature is emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The second line teaches that the <a id="calibre_link-584"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-585"></a>feeling lacks inherent existence by comparing it to bubbles of water. If we examine a water bubble we will never find its essence. Similarly, if we examine our pleasant, unpleasant and neutral feelings we will never find an inherently existent essence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The third line teaches that the <a id="calibre_link-586"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-587"></a>discrimination lacks inherent existence by comparing it to a mirage. When we see a mirage, something that is mere appearance to mind is seen to be real. Similarly, though they appear to exist from their own side, our discriminations are also mere appearance to mind without even a trace of inherent existence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The fourth line teaches that the <a id="calibre_link-588"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-589"></a>compositional factors lacks inherent existence by comparing it to a plantain tree. No matter how much bark we peel from a plantain tree we never find a core. Similarly, no matter how rigorously we analyze our compositional factors we will never discover an inherently existent phenomenon.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The fifth line teaches that the <a id="calibre_link-590"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-591"></a>consciousness lacks inherent existence by comparing it to a magician’s illusion. Sometimes magicians conjure up the appearance of an animal or a person, but though these phenomena appear to mind they are mere illusions with no existence from their own side. Similarly, all our consciousnesses are manifestations of lack of inherent existence with no existence from their own side.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Explicitly this Sutra teaches the lack of inherent existence of the five aggregates but implicitly it reveals the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena. Since this is a Hinayana Sutra, we can know for certain that Buddha taught the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena to Hinayanists.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Another <a id="calibre_link-592"></a>Hinayana Sutra in which Buddha teaches lack of inherent existence is <span class="italic">Instruction to Katyayana</span>. Nagarjuna quotes this Sutra in <a id="calibre_link-593"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span>, where he says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">In <a id="calibre_link-594"></a><span class="italic">Instruction to Katyayana</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Existence, non-existence and both</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Are refuted by the Blessed One,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">The Knower of things and non-things.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Nagarjuna is saying that in this Hinayana Sutra Buddha explains the <a id="calibre_link-595"></a>middle way by refuting the two extremes &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-596"></a>extreme of existence (that phenomena are inherently existent) and the <a id="calibre_link-597"></a>extreme of non-existence (that phenomena do not exist at all).</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">It is clear from many sources, therefore, that Buddha taught the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena to Hinayanists. By meditating on the meaning of these teachings both Hearers and Solitary Realizers can attain liberation from samsara and become <a id="calibre_link-598"></a><a id="calibre_link-599"></a>Foe Destroyers.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> Previously it was said that it is not possible to attain liberation by relying on the views of the <a id="calibre_link-600"></a>Hinayana tenets of the Vaibhashika and Sautrantika schools, so how is it possible for Hinayanists to attain liberation and become Foe Destroyers?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para"><span class="italic">Answer</span> It is important to distinguish a proponent of Hinayana <a id="calibre_link-601"></a>tenets from a <a id="calibre_link-602"></a>Hinayanist. Within the four Buddhist schools, the tenets of the two lower schools &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-603"></a>Vaibhashika and the <a id="calibre_link-604"></a>Sautrantika &ndash; are called ‘Hinayana tenets’ and the tenets of the two higher schools &ndash; the Chittamatra and the Madhyamika &ndash; are called ‘<a id="calibre_link-605"></a>Mahayana tenets’. However, this does not mean that proponents of the lower tenets are necessarily Hinayanists or that proponents of the higher tenets are necessarily <a id="calibre_link-606"></a>Mahayanists. A Hinayanist is someone who is motivated by a wish to attain liberation from samsara for himself or herself alone. A Mahayanist is someone who is motivated by a wish to attain full enlightenment for the benefit of all living beings. Thus, the criterion of whether we are a Hinayanist or a Mahayanist is our motivation, not the tenets we propound.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are many cases of Mahayana practitioners propounding Vaibhashika or Sautrantika tenets and of <a id="calibre_link-607"></a>Hinayanists propounding Chittamatra or Madhyamika tenets. If a practitioner has bodhichitta motivation but holds the view of the Sautrantika or Vaibhashika schools he or she is a <a id="calibre_link-608"></a>Mahayanist propounding Hinayana tenets, but not a Hinayanist. However, even though such a practitioner may have <a id="calibre_link-609"></a>renunciation, <a id="calibre_link-610"></a>bodhichitta and tranquil abiding and even though he may be adept at meditation on the <a id="calibre_link-611"></a>four noble truths, he does not have a complete path to liberation because he lacks the path realizing the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Conversely, a practitioner who has only the motivation of renunciation but who holds the view of the Madhyamika-Prasangika school is a Hinayanist propounding Mahayana tenets but not a Mahayanist. Even though such a person has a Hinayana motivation, he nevertheless has a complete path to liberation because, being a Madhyamika-Prasangika, he has the view of the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena. Thus, anyone who holds the view of the <a id="calibre_link-612"></a>Madhyamika-Prasangika school, regardless of whether they have a Hinayana or a Mahayana motivation, has a complete path to liberation. On the other hand, those who subscribe to any other school, even if they have bodhichitta and even if they have <a id="calibre_link-613"></a>tranquil abiding and many other good qualities, cannot attain liberation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">In conclusion, there is no contradiction in saying that proponents of <a id="calibre_link-614"></a>Hinayana tenets cannot attain liberation whereas Hinayanists can. Hinayanists definitely have a complete path to liberation because they have the path realizing the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">REJECTING ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS TEACHING</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">There is a <a id="calibre_link-615"></a>debate between two of Nagarjuna’s disciples &ndash; <a id="calibre_link-616"></a>Buddhapalita, who is a Madhyamika-Prasangika, and <a id="calibre_link-617"></a>Bhavaviveka, who is the founder of the Madhyamika-Svatantrika school. In his commentary to <a id="calibre_link-618"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> Buddhapalita explains that Hinayana Sutras teach lack of inherent existence. Bhavaviveka objects to this, saying that if that were the case there would have been no point in Buddha teaching the Mahayana Sutras because he would already have taught lack of inherent existence. Chandrakirti dismisses Bhavaviveka’s objection in his <a id="calibre_link-619"></a><span class="italic">Autocommentary </span>to the<span class="italic"> Guide</span>. He gives two reasons why Buddha taught the Mahayana Sutras even though he had already explained lack of inherent existence in the <a id="calibre_link-620"></a>Hinayana Sutras. First, the Mahayana Sutras reveal all the stages of the vast path from the cultivation of compassion through to the attainment of Buddhahood, and these are not taught in the Hinayana Sutras. Second, <a id="calibre_link-621"></a>Mahayana Sutras explain emptiness much more extensively than Hinayana Sutras. <a id="calibre_link-622"></a>Mahayanists strive to attain great enlightenment and this entails abandoning not just the delusions but also their <a id="calibre_link-623"></a>imprints, the <a id="calibre_link-624"></a>obstructions to omniscience. To accomplish this they have to attain very special <a id="calibre_link-625"></a>wisdoms on the patience stage of the <a id="calibre_link-626"></a>path of preparation and on the <a id="calibre_link-627"></a>seventh and <a id="calibre_link-628"></a>eighth grounds. Since this requires elaborate meditation on emptiness using countless forms of reasoning, Buddha gave a comprehensive explanation of emptiness in the Mahayana Sutras. <a id="calibre_link-629"></a>Hinayanists, on the other hand, are concerned to abandon only the delusions, or obstructions to liberation, so that they can attain the peace of nirvana. Since this can be accomplished with a relatively brief meditation on emptiness, Buddha did not teach emptiness extensively in the Hinayana Sutras.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Besides this objection and its reply explained in the <span class="italic">Autocommentary</span>, there are many other arguments and counterarguments raised on this point. These are explained by Je Tsongkhapa in <a id="calibre_link-630"></a><span class="italic">Clear Illumination of the Intention</span>, but fearing that they will take up too much space I will not elaborate on them here.</p>

			<p class="text-heading">THE SURPASSING GOOD QUALITY OF THE FIRST GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This section has four parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	An explanation of the <a id="calibre_link-635"></a>giving of one who abides on the <a id="calibre_link-636"></a>first ground</p>

			<p class="text-heading">AN EXPLANATION OF THE GIVING OF ONE WHO ABIDES ON THE <a id="calibre_link-637"></a>FIRST GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.9] At that time giving, the first cause of the enlightenment of complete Buddhahood,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Becomes surpassing for him.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">That he acts gracefully even when giving his own flesh</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Is a reason for inferring the non-apparent.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">When a Bodhisattva reaches the first ground his or her practice of the <a id="calibre_link-638"></a>perfection of <a id="calibre_link-639"></a>giving becomes surpassing. This does not mean that he practises only the perfection of giving &ndash; Bodhisattvas practise all ten perfections on each of the ten grounds. The meaning is that on the first ground he attains a degree of force in his practice of giving that he has not yet attained in his practice of the remaining perfections, moral discipline and so forth. Thus, whereas a Bodhisattva on the second ground has abandoned all faults discordant with pure moral discipline, the Bodhisattva on the first ground has not yet done so, but he has abandoned all stains of <a id="calibre_link-640"></a>miserliness and attachment that are discordant with the perfection of giving. Therefore his practice of the perfection of giving is said to be surpassing. He is now completely free from the stains of miserliness and feels no sense of loss when <a id="calibre_link-641"></a>giving away his wealth, his possessions or even his <a id="calibre_link-642"></a>body.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">If someone were to ask a first-ground Bodhisattva for some of his flesh he would give it gladly without his joy diminishing or his physical demeanour altering. This is a conclusive reason for inferring that he has attained very special realizations of giving that are not apparent to ordinary beings. If there is a fire inside a house someone on the outside will not be able to see it directly but they can correctly infer its presence from the smoke issuing from the chimney. Just as the smoke, which is apparent, indicates the existence of the fire, which is not, so a first-ground Bodhisattva’s external behaviour indicates extraordinary inner realizations that otherwise remain hidden to ordinary beings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-643"></a>giving is a virtuous determination to give. We engage in the practice of giving when we give to others and when we simply generate or increase our determination to give. There are three types of <a id="calibre_link-644"></a><a id="calibre_link-645"></a>giving &ndash; giving material things, giving Dharma and giving fearlessness. If possible we should practise all three. If we lack the resources to give material things we should still try to practise the other two, and if we cannot give Dharma we should at least practise giving fearlessness. This is defined as a virtuous determination to protect others from fears and problems. It includes such practices as protecting the lives of insects and animals, helping those who are lost, helping friends and neighbours when they have problems and bestowing peace of mind on those who are troubled. There is no one who cannot practise this type of giving.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-646"></a>perfection of giving is any giving maintained by bodhichitta. Although anyone, whether Mahayanist or Hinayanist, Buddhist or non-Buddhist, can practise giving, only those who have generated bodhichitta and entered the Mahayana path can practise the perfection of giving. There are two types of perfection of giving &ndash; the transcending perfection of giving and the transcendent perfection of giving. An example of the first is a Bodhisattva’s perfection of giving and an example of the second is a Buddha’s perfection of giving.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">AN EXPLANATION OF THE GIVING OF LOWER BASES</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This section explains the giving practised by ordinary beings who are not Bodhisattvas. It has two parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Attaining samsaric happiness through <a id="calibre_link-647"></a><a id="calibre_link-648"></a>giving</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Attaining the happiness of nirvana through giving</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ATTAINING SAMSARIC HAPPINESS THROUGH GIVING</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.10] All these beings strongly desire happiness</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And humans cannot be happy without enjoyments.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Knowing that these enjoyments come from giving,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">The Able One taught giving first.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">All beings desire <a id="calibre_link-649"></a><a id="calibre_link-650"></a>happiness and <a id="calibre_link-651"></a>humans cannot be happy without basic <a id="calibre_link-652"></a>enjoyments such as food, drink, clothing and shelter. If they lack these they experience the miseries of hunger, thirst, cold and so forth. Knowing that the basic enjoyments that alleviate these sufferings are the result of the practice of giving, Buddha taught giving as the first of the ten perfections.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">If our enjoyments were the result of this life’s endeavours alone anyone who strove to become rich would succeed, yet there are many people who work hard at business with no success while there are others who seem to accumulate wealth with almost no effort. This is because <a id="calibre_link-653"></a>wealth is the result of giving in former lives. If we have strong imprints from previous giving we will accumulate wealth with little difficulty, but if we lack such imprints we will never become rich no matter how hard we try. Seeing the benefits of giving and seeing that all enjoyments come from giving, both Buddhists and non-Buddhists value this practice.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Whereas humans depend on physical resources for their happiness, <a id="calibre_link-654"></a>gods of the <a id="calibre_link-655"></a>form and <a id="calibre_link-656"></a>formless realms do not. They never experience the sufferings of hunger, thirst and so on, but abide continuously in the peace and happiness of meditative concentration with no need of food, drink, clothing or shelter. They do not even suffer sickness and ageing, although they do experience the sufferings of birth, death and pervasive <a id="calibre_link-657"></a>suffering.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> Do all humans depend on material comforts for their happiness?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> Within the human realm there are some pure Dharma practitioners who, through the power of their spiritual realizations, experience continuous peace and happiness even though they may lack many worldly enjoyments. When Chandrakirti says that humans cannot be happy without enjoyments he is referring not to such practitioners but to ordinary humans who have little or no experience of Dharma.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> To receive results such as <a id="calibre_link-658"></a>wealth and resources, is it necessary to practise giving as part of a spiritual practice?</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.11] Even for those with little compassion and very rough minds</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Who pursue only their own interests</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Desired enjoyments that cause the alleviation of suffering</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Arise from giving.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para"><span class="italic">Answer</span> No. Giving is a virtuous action and so it is always beneficial, even when it is not part of a spiritual practice. For example, people engaged in business understand that it is necessary to give away a little to receive greater returns in the future. There are many people with little or no compassion who are concerned only with their own interests and whose minds can be very rough when dealing with others, yet even they receive worldly <a id="calibre_link-659"></a>enjoyments that temporarily alleviate sufferings such as poverty as a result of their giving.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Usually the results of giving are experienced in future lives, but there are some people who experience them later in the same life. For example, someone might give generously when they are young and as a result experience prosperity towards the end of their life.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ATTAINING THE HAPPINESS OF <a id="calibre_link-660"></a>NIRVANA THROUGH GIVING</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.12] Even they on some occasion of giving</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Will soon come to meet a Superior being.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Then having severed the continuum of samsara completely</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Those who possess this cause will go to peace.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Even those who have little compassion but who are happy to give will practise giving continuously and one day, in some cases quite soon, meet a <a id="calibre_link-661"></a>Superior or other realized being as the object of their generosity. That <a id="calibre_link-662"></a>holy being will then help them to develop renunciation by explaining the faults of samsara. As a result they will practise Dharma purely and eventually sever the continuum of samsara and attain the peace of liberation. The initial cause of this peace, meeting a holy being, is itself the result of the practice of giving. Thus, by practising giving we can attain not only samsaric happiness but also the happiness of nirvana.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">AN EXPLANATION OF <a id="calibre_link-663"></a>BODHISATTVAS’ GIVING</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Having explained the benefits of giving practised by ordinary beings who are not Bodhisattvas, Chandrakirti now explains the uncommon characteristics of Bodhisattvas’ giving. This section has four parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The uncommon benefits of Bodhisattvas’ giving</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	The instructions on giving are fundamental for both bases</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">3	The great joy a Bodhisattva obtains from giving</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">4	Whether a Bodhisattva experiences pain when giving away his body</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE UNCOMMON BENEFITS OF BODHISATTVAS’ GIVING</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.13ab] Those who hold in their mind a promise to help living beings</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Immediately experience joy from </span><span class="bold"><a id="calibre_link-664"></a><a id="calibre_link-665"></a></span><span class="bold">giving.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Everyone eventually experiences <a id="calibre_link-666"></a>happiness as a result of giving, but Bodhisattvas experience immediate joy. This is the uncommon benefit of Bodhisattvas’ giving and it leads them to practise <a id="calibre_link-667"></a>giving with great enthusiasm. Ordinary beings, on the other hand, do not experience the results of <a id="calibre_link-668"></a>giving immediately and so they have little enthusiasm for it.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Most people do not like being asked to give, and sometimes they even respond with resentment or anger. Moreover, when they part with something, they do not immediately experience joy from having given but usually feel a sense of loss or regret. Even a Hinayana <a id="calibre_link-669"></a>Foe Destroyer, because he or she lacks great compassion, will not immediately generate joy at the prospect of giving, or rejoice in the satisfaction of the receiver. The first-ground Bodhisattva, however, has promised to help all living beings by bestowing on them temporary and ultimate happiness whenever he or she can. His compassion for those in need is like a mother’s love for her children, and so whenever he is asked to give something he immediately experiences great joy just from hearing the word ‘give’. Delighted with the opportunity to practise giving, he feels as if he has discovered a precious treasure, and as soon as he sees he has satisfied the receiver he spontaneously generates supreme joy.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE INSTRUCTIONS ON GIVING ARE FUNDAMENTAL FOR BOTH BASES</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.13cd] Therefore whether one is compassionate or not</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">The instructions on giving are fundamental.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Whether one is a Bodhisattva or not the practice of giving is very important because, as already explained, it leads to the temporary happiness of samsara and the ultimate happiness of liberation. Therefore, we should regard the instructions on the practice of giving as fundamental. In <a id="calibre_link-670"></a><span class="italic">Friendly Letter </span>Nagarjuna offers the following advice to King Udayabhadra:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">There is no better friend for the future than giving &ndash;</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">On <a id="calibre_link-671"></a>ordained people, brahmins, the poor and friends</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Realizing enjoyments to be transient and essenceless.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Ordinary friends can help us only in this life, but giving brings us enjoyments in many future lives. Therefore we should regard the practice of giving as our best friend. Je Tsongkhapa also praises giving in <a id="calibre_link-672"></a><span class="italic">Condensed Exposition of the Stages of the Path</span>:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Giving is the wish-granting jewel that fulfils the hopes of living beings,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">The supreme weapon for cutting the knot of miserliness,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">The action of the Conquerors’ Son with a courageous heart</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">And the basis for proclaiming his fame throughout the ten directions.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">I who am a Yogi practised in this way;</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">You who seek liberation, please do the same.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Also <a id="calibre_link-673"></a>Milarepa says in <a id="calibre_link-674"></a><span class="italic">Songs of Speech</span>:</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">When we <a id="calibre_link-675"></a>die we have to depart from this world alone, leaving our bodies and all our possessions to others, but leaving everything behind without any choice is not a practice of giving and brings no benefit. Therefore Milarepa says it is better to give away our possessions now while we still have the choice. Only in this way can we derive some meaning from having owned them. In the Sutras, Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">The rich who do not practise giving</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Are as if guarding other people’s treasure,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">And the wise who do not keep their commitments</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last-full-space-below">Are like rotten, hollow trees.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GREAT JOY A BODHISATTVA OBTAINS FROM GIVING</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.14] If from hearing and contemplating the word ‘Give’,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">The Conquerors’ Son develops a bliss</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">The like of which is not aroused in the Able Ones through experiencing peace,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">What can be said about giving everything?</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Because they are completely free from the sufferings of samsara Hinayana <a id="calibre_link-676"></a>Foe Destroyers experience extraordinary peace and happiness, but this happiness does not begin to compare with the bliss experienced by a Bodhisattva when he or she is asked to give something. Whenever a Bodhisattva is asked by others to give he experiences extraordinary bliss just from hearing the words and contemplating their meaning. If Hinayana Foe Destroyers do not experience a bliss that compares with this, how can we begin to describe the bliss experienced by the Bodhisattva when he gives away everything, including his body?</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WHETHER A BODHISATTVA EXPERIENCES PAIN WHEN <a id="calibre_link-677"></a>GIVING AWAY HIS BODY</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> Although a Bodhisattva develops bliss when he is asked to give and when he is actually <a id="calibre_link-678"></a>giving, does he not experience pain when he gives away his <a id="calibre_link-679"></a>body?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> This depends on whether he or she is a <a id="calibre_link-680"></a>Superior Bodhisattva or an ordinary Bodhisattva. A Superior Bodhisattva will experience no pain and no sense of loss when parting with his body, even if he were slowly to cut it into many pieces. There are two reasons for this. First, because he has a direct <a id="calibre_link-681"></a>realization of the lack of inherent existence of the I and the body he does not experience pain. Second, because he has completed the practice of <a id="calibre_link-682"></a>exchanging self with others he is utterly without <a id="calibre_link-683"></a>self-cherishing and so there is no basis for suffering to arise. In <a id="calibre_link-684"></a><span class="italic">Question of Gaganganja Sutra</span> Buddha says that just as a large tree experiences no pain and no sense of loss when its branches are cut off, so a Superior Bodhisattva would experience no pain and no sense of loss if someone out of malice were to cut off all his limbs. He would feel only joy at having the opportunity to give away his body for the sake of others. Also, in <a id="calibre_link-685"></a><span class="italic">Commentary to Valid Cognition</span> Dharmakirti says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">He is said to be separate from <a id="calibre_link-686"></a>attachment,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">As with sandalwood and axe.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">If one person were respectfully to anoint a <a id="calibre_link-687"></a>Superior Bodhisattva’s body with sandalwood while another angrily attacked it with an axe, that Bodhisattva would not feel close to one and distant from the other, but would have equal compassion for both. This is because he is completely free from attachment to his body.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">An ordinary <a id="calibre_link-688"></a>Bodhisattva, on the other hand, does experience pain when his or her body is cut. However, he is able to use this experience to strengthen his practice. The root text says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.15] Through the pain from cutting and giving his body</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">He sees from his own experience</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">The suffering of others in the hells and elsewhere</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">And strives with great effort to eliminate it quickly.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">If an ordinary Bodhisattva cuts his body and gives it away he uses his own experience of pain to contemplate the <a id="calibre_link-689"></a>suffering of other living beings such as <a id="calibre_link-690"></a>hell beings, <a id="calibre_link-691"></a>hungry ghosts and <a id="calibre_link-692"></a>animals who are trapped in lower realms. Seeing that their suffering is infinitely greater than his own, he thinks only of them and strives with great effort to attain enlightenment quickly so that he can eliminate their pain.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Those who have taken <a id="calibre_link-693"></a>Bodhisattva <a id="calibre_link-694"></a>vows have a commitment to train in the practice of giving everything including their virtues, their possessions and their body. However, Buddha warned us not to give up our body if we lack the motivation of great compassion, if we cannot bear the pain or if the sacrifice would serve no great purpose, for to part with our body with a narrow or unhappy mind would be a great hindrance to our practice. At our stage we should simply cultivate the intention to gain the ability to give our body.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">To appreciate fully the extraordinary qualities of the first-ground Bodhisattva’s giving we should contemplate them repeatedly. When as a result of our contemplations we develop a feeling of <a id="calibre_link-695"></a>rejoicing in the Bodhisattva’s good qualities we should hold this feeling as our object of placement meditation. Finally we should dedicate our merit with the prayer, ‘May I quickly attain all these good qualities.’ Rejoicing in the good qualities of the first-ground Bodhisattva helps us to develop an aspiration to attain them ourself.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE DIVISIONS OF THE PERFECTION OF GIVING</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[I.16] Giving with emptiness of giver, gift and receiver</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">It is explained as a mundane perfection.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Chandrakirti briefly explains a twofold division of the <a id="calibre_link-696"></a><a id="calibre_link-697"></a><a id="calibre_link-698"></a>perfection of giving into supramundane and mundane. A perfection of giving maintained by the wisdom directly realizing the emptiness of the <a id="calibre_link-699"></a>three spheres &ndash; the giver, the gift and the receiver &ndash; is a supramundane perfection of giving. A perfection of giving in someone who does not have a realization of the lack of inherent existence of the three spheres but who still conceives them to be inherently existent is a mundane perfection. Mundane perfections are practised only by ordinary Bodhisattvas, supramundane perfections only by Superior Bodhisattvas and Buddhas.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">CONCLUSION BY WAY OF EXPRESSING THE GOOD QUALITIES OF THE GROUND</p>

In the scriptures the moon is sometimes called the ‘<a id="calibre_link-702"></a>water crystal jewel’ because its light is cool and the sun is sometimes called the ‘<a id="calibre_link-703"></a>fire crystal jewel’ because its rays are warm.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The first ground has three points of similarity with the moon:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	Just as the moon abides in a high place, so the first ground abides in the mind of the highly-realized Bodhisattva</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(2)	Just as the moon beautifies the sky with light, so the first ground beautifies the holy mind of the Conquerors’ Son with the light of wisdom</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-last">(3)	Just as the moon dispels the darkness of the night, so the first ground dispels the thick darkness of confusion obscuring the view of emptiness, and is victorious over the intellectually-formed delusions.</p>

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Explanation of the second ground</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Introduction to the second ground has four parts:</p>

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	Definition of the second ground</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">3	Divisions of the second ground</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">4	Etymology of the second ground</p>
			<p class="text-heading">HOW THE SECOND GROUND IS ATTAINED</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Even though the <a id="calibre_link-706"></a>Bodhisattva on the first ground has abandoned <a id="calibre_link-707"></a><a id="calibre_link-708"></a>intellectually-formed true-grasping, he or she still has innate true-grasping. There are nine levels of innate true-grasping &ndash; big-big, middling-big, small-big, big-middling, middling-middling, small-middling, big-small, middling-small and small-small. These are gradually abandoned by the Bodhisattva on the next seven grounds.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">While still on the first ground, the Bodhisattva continues to meditate on emptiness until he or she attains a wisdom that functions as the direct antidote to the grossest type of innate true-grasping, big-big. This wisdom is known as the ‘<a id="calibre_link-709"></a>uninterrupted path of the <a id="calibre_link-710"></a>path of meditation of the first ground’ because when the Bodhisattva attains it he or she  advances to the path of meditation but remains on the first ground. In the next moment of the same meditation he attains the <a id="calibre_link-711"></a>released path that has completely abandoned big-big innate true-grasping. This is the first moment of the second ground. Thus, he advances from the first ground to the second while in meditative equipoise. Whereas the first ground begins with an uninterrupted path, the second and subsequent grounds begin with a released path.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DEFINITION OF THE SECOND GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of the <a id="calibre_link-712"></a>second ground is a Superior Bodhisattva’s path that has abandoned big-big innate true-grasping, its principal object of abandonment, and that has attained a surpassing practice of the perfection of moral discipline from within the ten perfections.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS OF THE SECOND GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-713"></a>second ground has three divisions &ndash; the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the second ground, the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment of the second ground and the exalted awareness of the second ground that is neither of the two. The first has three divisions &ndash; the released path of the second ground, the uninterrupted path of the second ground and the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the second ground that is neither of the two. The first of these occurs at the very beginning of the second ground and the second, which is the direct antidote to middling-big innate true-grasping, occurs at the very end. The exalted awareness of meditative equipoise that is neither of the two is any meditative equipoise on emptiness between these two. This and the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment arise alternately.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ETYMOLOGY OF THE SECOND GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-714"></a>second ground is called ‘Stainless’ because a Bodhisattva on this ground is completely free from stains of degenerate moral discipline and uncommon Hinayana attitudes.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">EXPLANATION OF THE SECOND GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The second ground will now be explained extensively under five headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The completely pure <a id="calibre_link-715"></a>moral discipline on this ground</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	A praise of moral discipline</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">3	An illustration of separation from that which is incompatible with moral discipline</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">4	The divisions of the perfection of moral discipline</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">5	Conclusion by way of expressing the good qualities of the ground</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE COMPLETELY PURE MORAL DISCIPLINE ON THIS GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This section has four parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The excellent moral discipline on this ground</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	The completely pure qualities that depend on this</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">3	This moral discipline surpasses that of the first ground</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">4	Another cause of completely pure moral discipline</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE EXCELLENT MORAL DISCIPLINE ON THIS GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.1ab] Because he possesses excellent </span><span class="bold"><a id="calibre_link-716"></a></span><span class="bold">moral discipline and pure qualities</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">He has abandoned the stains of degenerate discipline even in his dreams.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Because the Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-717"></a>second ground possesses excellent <a id="calibre_link-718"></a>moral discipline and many pure qualities he is not polluted by the stains of degenerate moral discipline or its imprints even in his dreams. Most ordinary beings, including those who keep pure moral discipline while they are awake, break their moral discipline in their dreams. For example, there are some who are very careful not to take life while they are awake but who sometimes dream of killing. Similarly there are those who never commit sexual misconduct while awake but who do so in their dreams. Such dreams arise from the imprints of faulty moral discipline that remain in the mind even after we have begun to practise pure moral discipline. Because the Bodhisattva on the second ground has abandoned these imprints his mind is always pure, even in his dreams.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-719"></a>moral discipline is a virtuous determination to abandon non-virtuous actions and faults. To practise moral discipline we must have an intention to refrain from non-virtuous actions, otherwise we would have to say that stones and trees practise moral discipline because they never do anything wrong! To practise moral discipline we contemplate the disadvantages of non-virtuous actions, generate a strong determination to abandon such actions and then conscientiously avoid committing them. If we wish, we can make a promise in front of a holy being but this is not essential. It is sufficient simply to make a strong inner determination and then to practise purely. If having made such a determination we then commit non-virtuous actions, we incur moral faults.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Some actions however are naturally harmful and should be avoided at all times, regardless of whether or not we have decided to refrain from them. These are &ndash; killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, idle chatter, covetousness, harmful thought and holding <a id="calibre_link-720"></a>wrong views. The moral discipline of refraining from these <a id="calibre_link-721"></a>ten <a id="calibre_link-722"></a>non-virtuous actions is fundamental and should be practised by everyone. Whether we are a Superior being or an ordinary being, a Mahayanist or a Hinayanist, a Buddhist or a non-Buddhist, we always need to refrain from these actions.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are three types of <a id="calibre_link-723"></a>moral discipline &ndash; the moral discipline of restraint, the moral discipline of gathering virtuous Dharmas and the moral discipline of benefiting living beings. There is also a threefold division from the point of view of <a id="calibre_link-724"></a>vows &ndash; the moral discipline observing the Pratimoksha vows, the moral discipline observing the <a id="calibre_link-725"></a>Bodhisattva vows and the moral discipline observing the Tantric vows.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-726"></a><a id="calibre_link-727"></a>perfection of moral discipline is any moral discipline maintained by bodhichitta. It has two divisions &ndash; the transcending perfection of moral discipline and the transcendent perfection of moral discipline. The first is practised by Bodhisattvas and the second by Buddhas. Another division of the perfection of moral discipline is given below.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE COMPLETELY PURE QUALITIES THAT DEPEND ON THIS</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.1cd] Because his conduct of body, speech and mind is pure</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">He accumulates all ten paths of holy actions.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The Bodhisattva on the second ground has many pure qualities that arise from his or her moral discipline. Because his conduct of body, speech and mind is always completely pure, without even a trace of defilement, he accumulates all <a id="calibre_link-728"></a>ten <a id="calibre_link-729"></a>virtuous actions. There are three virtuous actions of body &ndash; abandoning killing, abandoning stealing and abandoning sexual misconduct; four virtuous actions of speech &ndash; abandoning lying, abandoning divisive speech, abandoning hurtful speech and abandoning idle chatter; and three virtuous actions of mind &ndash; abandoning covetousness, abandoning harmful thought and abandoning holding wrong views. Chandrakirti calls these actions ‘holy’ actions because they protect us from lower rebirth and lead to <a id="calibre_link-730"></a>happiness in both this and future lives. If we practise the moral discipline of abandoning the ten non-virtuous actions our conduct of body, speech and mind will gradually become pure, and we will acquire pure qualities similar to those of a second-ground Bodhisattva.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THIS MORAL DISCIPLINE SURPASSES THAT OF THE FIRST GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.2] For him all these ten virtuous paths</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Are perfected and so extremely pure.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Like the </span><span class="bold"><a id="calibre_link-731"></a></span><span class="bold">autumn moon he is always completely pure.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Pacified and radiant, he is beautified by these.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> Does a Bodhisattva on the first ground also practise pure moral discipline?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para"><span class="italic">Answer</span> Yes. Bodhisattvas on the first ground practise the ten virtuous actions purely, but for the second-ground Bodhisattva these actions are perfected and so completely pure. Therefore the second-ground Bodhisattva’s <a id="calibre_link-732"></a>moral discipline surpasses that of the first-ground Bodhisattva.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Just as the autumn moon relieves the pain of heat and fills the sky with pure white light so the second-ground Bodhisattva’s realization of pure <a id="calibre_link-733"></a>moral discipline pacifies his mind by relieving the painful heat of the delusions and generates a mental lucidity and radiance that beautifies his body. <a id="calibre_link-734"></a>Atisha once told his disciple, <a id="calibre_link-735"></a>Jangchub Ö, ‘Always keep pure moral discipline, for it leads to beauty in this life and happiness hereafter.’ If we follow Atisha’s advice we will also come to possess these special qualities. In <a id="calibre_link-736"></a><span class="italic">Condensed Exposition of the Stages of the Path</span> Je Tsongkhapa says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><a id="calibre_link-737"></a>Moral discipline is the water that cleanses the stains of misconduct</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">And the moonlight that relieves the painful heat of the delusions.</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Resplendent as a great mountain amidst all living beings,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">All beings bow down to it without threat of force.</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Knowing this, the holy protect as they would their eyes</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">The discipline that they have vowed to observe.</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">I who am a Yogi practised in this way;</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">You who seek liberation, please do the same.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">In many Buddhist countries there is great respect for <a id="calibre_link-738"></a>monks and nuns, not just because they wear robes but because they observe pure discipline. Similarly anyone, lay or ordained, who keeps the moral discipline observing the <a id="calibre_link-739"></a>Bodhisattva <a id="calibre_link-740"></a>vows or the moral discipline observing the <a id="calibre_link-741"></a>Tantric vows is held in great esteem. <a id="calibre_link-742"></a>Shantideva says that simply by generating <a id="calibre_link-743"></a>bodhichitta we become worthy of veneration by humans and gods, so how much more respect is due to those who take the Bodhisattva vows and keep them purely?</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ANOTHER CAUSE OF COMPLETELY PURE MORAL DISCIPLINE</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.3] If we keep pure moral discipline with the view of inherent existence</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Then because of that our moral discipline is not pure.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Therefore, he is always completely free from the wanderings</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Of the dualistic mind towards the three.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">If we refrain from non-virtuous actions and practise virtue we are practising pure <a id="calibre_link-744"></a>moral discipline, but if we view our practice as inherently existent it will not be completely pure. A Bodhisattva on the second ground never views his practice as inherently existent and so he attains complete purity of moral discipline.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> Since proponents of all the lower tenets view phenomena as inherently existent, does this mean that they are incapable of keeping pure moral discipline?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> No. For example, there are both lay and ordained <a id="calibre_link-745"></a>Chittamatrins who keep very pure moral discipline. If a Chittamatrin is practising the moral discipline of abandoning the ten non-virtuous actions we cannot say that he is not observing pure moral discipline, but because he views himself, his practice and the objects of his practice as inherently existent his moral discipline is not as pure as that of a second-ground Bodhisattva.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">According to the Madhyamika-Prasangika school, moral discipline is completely pure only when it is conjoined with the realization of lack of inherent existence. The main purpose of practising <a id="calibre_link-746"></a>moral discipline is to attain liberation or enlightenment, but a moral discipline that is strongly viewed as inherently existent is the cause of rebirth in <a id="calibre_link-747"></a>samsara because it is motivated by the ignorance of self-grasping. Since moral discipline is a virtuous practice it can never be the cause of lower <a id="calibre_link-748"></a>rebirth but it can be the cause of rebirth as a <a id="calibre_link-749"></a>human or a <a id="calibre_link-750"></a>god. However, even though we may still have self-grasping, if we practise moral discipline with the motivation of renunciation it will be a cause of <a id="calibre_link-751"></a>liberation, and if we practise with the motivation of bodhichitta it will be a cause of <a id="calibre_link-752"></a>enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">In <span class="italic">Condensed </span><span class="italic"><a id="calibre_link-753"></a></span><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutra</span> Buddha says that practising <a id="calibre_link-754"></a>virtuous actions while regarding them as inherently existent is like eating delicious food that is laced with poison. If we were to eat contaminated food our initial experience would be pleasure, but that would soon give way to suffering as the poison took effect. In the same way, if we practise moral discipline contaminated by the view of inherent existence, the initial effect will be a clear and happy mind and a radiant body, but the long-term effect will be further suffering from having taken another <a id="calibre_link-755"></a>rebirth in <a id="calibre_link-756"></a>samsara. In <a id="calibre_link-757"></a><span class="italic">Collection (Heap) of Jewels Sutra</span> Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-middle">Kashyapa, some monks possess moral discipline in so far as they abide within the restraints of the Pratimoksha vows, observe excellent rituals and spheres of activity, view even the slightest transgression with concern, perfectly assume and train in the bases of training and have completely pure livelihoods due to their very pure actions of body, speech and mind; and yet they propound a self. Kashyapa, they are the first of those who appear to possess moral discipline but who have faulty moral discipline . . .</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-last-para">Furthermore, Kashyapa, some monks perfectly assume the twelve qualities of training but they view them with apprehension, abiding in the apprehensions of ‘I’ and ‘mine’. Kashyapa, they are the fourth of those who appear to possess moral discipline but who have faulty moral discipline.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">In another Sutra, Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">If you practise moral discipline while viewing these spheres as inherently existent, that practice is not pure.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">All actions have three spheres. In the case of moral discipline they are the non-virtue that is abandoned, the person abandoning it and the being(s) with respect to whom it is abandoned. A mind that conceives these <a id="calibre_link-758"></a>three spheres to be inherently existent is a <a id="calibre_link-759"></a>dualistic mind because it falls into the two extremes. The Bodhisattva on the second ground has completely abandoned the wanderings of this dualistic mind and so his or her moral discipline is completely pure.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">There are many causes of the complete purification of moral discipline, but realizing the emptiness of the three spheres is the main cause. Although the Bodhisattva on the first ground also has this realization his <a id="calibre_link-760"></a>moral discipline does not become surpassing until he reaches the second ground. Therefore the complete purification of moral discipline is given as a quality of the second ground.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">A PRAISE OF MORAL DISCIPLINE</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This section has five parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Enjoying the fruits of giving in fortunate realms depends on moral discipline</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	Enjoying the fruits of giving continuously depends on moral discipline</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">3	It is extremely difficult for those who lack moral discipline to escape from the lower realms</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">4	Why the instructions on moral discipline were given after the instructions on giving</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">5	Praising moral discipline as a cause of both high status and definite goodness</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ENJOYING THE FRUITS OF <a id="calibre_link-761"></a>GIVING IN FORTUNATE REALMS DEPENDS ON MORAL DISCIPLINE</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.4ab] If enjoyments that result from giving arise in a lower rebirth</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">It is because that being broke his legs of </span><span class="bold"><a id="calibre_link-762"></a></span><span class="bold">moral discipline.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">It has already been explained that if we practise giving we will experience wealth and resources in future lives, but if we want to enjoy these fruits in the <a id="calibre_link-763"></a>human or god realm we must combine our practice of giving with the practice of <a id="calibre_link-764"></a>moral discipline because moral discipline is the cause of higher rebirth. If we practise giving without practising moral discipline we will experience the results in a lower <a id="calibre_link-765"></a>rebirth, for example as a pet dog in a wealthy household. There are many cases of <a id="calibre_link-766"></a>animals enjoying comfortable conditions just as there are many cases of humans experiencing deprivation. The former are the result of practising giving without moral discipline and the latter are the result of practising moral discipline without giving. Moral discipline is like legs. Those who have strong moral discipline will be able to travel to fortunate rebirths but those beings who break their legs of moral discipline will fall into the <a id="calibre_link-767"></a>lower realms. Therefore, while we still have this <a id="calibre_link-768"></a>precious human body we should use it to practise pure moral discipline and thereby ensure that we take a fortunate rebirth in our next life.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ENJOYING THE FRUITS OF GIVING CONTINUOUSLY DEPENDS ON MORAL DISCIPLINE</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.4cd] If both the interest and the capital are spent</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">No enjoyments will arise for him in the future.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">If the fruits of giving ripen in <a id="calibre_link-769"></a>lower rebirths they are consumed without fresh seeds being sown because beings in the lower realms have no opportunity to practise giving. For example, a dog born into a wealthy household experiences relative luxury and comfort during that life, but it uses up its good fortune without creating the cause for more. This is rather like a businessman spending both the interest and the capital, or a farmer consuming his harvest without sowing fresh seeds; there will be nothing for them to enjoy in the future.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">On the other hand, if as a result of practising moral discipline the fruits of <a id="calibre_link-770"></a>giving ripen in a fortunate rebirth we experience both prosperity, which is the environmental effect of giving, and a disposition to practise giving again, which is an effect that is a tendency similar to the cause. With both the resources and the disposition to give we will naturally practise giving again, thereby creating the cause for even more prosperity and an even greater disposition to give in the future. This in turn leads to even more prosperity and even more generosity and so on. Thus practising giving and moral discipline together creates the cause to enjoy the fruits of giving continuously in life after life.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WHO LACK MORAL DISCIPLINE TO ESCAPE FROM THE LOWER REALMS</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.5] If, when living in good conditions and acting with freedom,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">We do not act to hold ourself back,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Once we have fallen into the abyss and lost our freedom</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">How will we raise ourself from there in the future?</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">In <a id="calibre_link-771"></a>samsara there are only two types of rebirth &ndash; rebirth in the higher realms of humans and gods and rebirth in the <a id="calibre_link-772"></a>lower realms of <a id="calibre_link-773"></a>hell beings, <a id="calibre_link-774"></a>hungry ghosts and <a id="calibre_link-775"></a>animals. The principal cause of rebirth in the higher realms is the practice of moral discipline. If we do not practise moral discipline we lack the cause of <a id="calibre_link-776"></a>higher rebirth and so when we die we will definitely be reborn in the lower realms. There is no alternative.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Right now we have a <a id="calibre_link-777"></a>precious human life and the freedom to control our actions. If while we have such good conditions we do not protect ourself from falling into a lower rebirth by practising pure moral discipline, once we have fallen into the abyss of the lower realms and lost all our freedom, how will we raise ourself to the higher realms again? It seems almost impossible.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The reason it is very difficult for beings in the lower realms to escape is that they cannot practise moral discipline, which is the main cause of higher rebirth. We have only to look at animals to see how difficult it is to practise moral discipline in a lower rebirth. All animals instinctively commit negative actions. Cats, for example, are never free from non-virtuous minds; day and night they have the desire to kill. They do not need to be trained to kill or to steal. It is almost impossible for animals to practise virtue. We can train a dog to catch balls, protect property, round up sheep, apprehend criminals and excel at various sports, but if we tell a dog that it can attain enlightenment by reciting just one <a id="calibre_link-778"></a>mantra it cannot even understand what we are saying. Since it is so difficult to practise moral discipline in the lower realms, once we are born there, there is a great danger of our taking one lower rebirth after another. Therefore we should practise moral discipline now to protect ourself from falling into lower rebirths in the future, and we should develop compassion for those who are already trapped there.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">This verse is extremely important and we should contemplate it repeatedly. Many of the great <a id="calibre_link-779"></a>Kadampa <a id="calibre_link-780"></a>Geshes used to begin their meditations by reciting this verse and reflecting on its meaning. If we do the same our mind will naturally turn towards Dharma.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WHY THE INSTRUCTIONS ON MORAL DISCIPLINE WERE GIVEN AFTER THE INSTRUCTIONS ON GIVING</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.6] Therefore the Conqueror taught moral discipline</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">After he had taught giving.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">When qualities grow in the field of moral discipline</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">The fruits will be enjoyed unceasingly.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">If we practise giving in conjunction with moral discipline its fruits will be enjoyed unceasingly in fortunate realms, but if we practise giving without <a id="calibre_link-781"></a>moral discipline the results will be wasted in the lower realms. Because it is unwise to practise giving without considering the kind of rebirth in which we will experience the results, Buddha taught moral discipline immediately after he had taught giving.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">PRAISING MORAL DISCIPLINE AS A CAUSE OF BOTH HIGH STATUS AND DEFINITE GOODNESS</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.7] There is no cause other than moral discipline</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">For the high status and definite goodness</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Of ordinary beings, those born from the speech,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Those definite in self-enlightenment and Conquerors’ Sons.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">There are two types of <a id="calibre_link-782"></a>happiness &ndash; the happiness of <a id="calibre_link-783"></a>high status, which is the <a id="calibre_link-784"></a>happiness of <a id="calibre_link-785"></a>humans and gods, and the happiness of <a id="calibre_link-786"></a>definite goodness, which is the happiness of liberation and enlightenment. Ordinary beings who have not yet entered spiritual paths desire the happiness of humans and gods, Hearers and Solitary Realizers desire the happiness of liberation and Bodhisattvas desire the happiness of great enlightenment. None of these desires can be fulfilled without the practice of <a id="calibre_link-787"></a>moral discipline. Although there are many other causes of happiness, such as the other perfections, they cannot produce happiness if moral discipline is lacking. Therefore Chandrakirti says that there is no cause of <a id="calibre_link-788"></a>happiness other than moral discipline.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">AN ILLUSTRATION OF SEPARATION FROM THAT WHICH IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH MORAL DISCIPLINE</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.8] As with an ocean and a corpse together,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And auspiciousness and misfortune together,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">So too this great being controlled by moral discipline</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Has no desire to remain with that which is degenerate.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">If a corpse is thrown into an ocean it is usually washed ashore. We would say that it is brought ashore by the waves, but according to some Buddhist texts it is thrown ashore by <a id="calibre_link-789"></a>nagas living in the ocean who do not wish to share their abode with such an unclean object. Just as an ocean and a corpse cannot remain together, so auspiciousness and misfortune cannot remain together because when conditions are good there is no place for misfortune. These analogies illustrate how the Bodhisattva on the second ground whose mind is completely controlled by moral discipline has no desire to remain with faulty moral discipline.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The Bodhisattva on the second ground abandons both gross and subtle moral faults. Gross moral faults are <a id="calibre_link-790"></a>non-virtuous actions such as killing, stealing or lying and subtle moral faults are thoughts to commit such actions that arise from imprints in the mind. Because conditions conducive to moral discipline are so rare it is difficult for <a id="calibre_link-791"></a>ordinary beings to abandon even one gross moral fault such as killing let alone all ten <a id="calibre_link-792"></a>non-virtuous actions. Needless to say, there are very few beings who can also cleanse their minds of all the imprints of non-virtue. From this we can see that the practice of <a id="calibre_link-793"></a>moral discipline is vast and complete purity is extremely rare. Therefore we should rejoice in the purity of the second-ground Bodhisattva for whom even the slightest trace of moral degeneration is anathema.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE DIVISIONS OF THE PERFECTION OF MORAL DISCIPLINE</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.9] If there is observation of the three </span><span class="bold">&ndash;</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">That which is empty of attachment to the three is supramundane.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-794"></a>perfection of moral discipline has two divisions &ndash; the mundane perfection of moral discipline and the supramundane perfection of moral discipline. A perfection of moral discipline in one who conceives the three spheres &ndash; what is abandoned, by whom and with respect to whom &ndash; to be inherently existent is a mundane perfection of moral discipline. A perfection of moral discipline maintained by a direct realization of the lack of inherent existence of the three spheres is a supramundane perfection of moral discipline. The mundane perfection of moral discipline is practised only by ordinary Bodhisattvas and the supramundane perfection only by Mahayana Superiors. Here, ‘that which is empty of attachment’ refers to the moral discipline practised by Mahayana Superiors who have abandoned all intellectually-formed delusions.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">CONCLUSION BY WAY OF EXPRESSING THE GOOD QUALITIES OF THE GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[II.10] This Stainless, free from stains, arises from the moon, the Conquerors’ Son,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Who although not of samsara is the glory of samsara;</span></p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Just as moonlight arises from the <a id="calibre_link-795"></a><a id="calibre_link-796"></a>moon, so the second ground arises from the second-ground Bodhisattva who is radiant with the light of stainless moral discipline. Although he is no longer of samsara, out of great compassion he continues to take rebirth in the abodes of samsara, where he is the source of all happiness and good fortune. Just as the autumn moon free from obstruction by clouds soothes the torment of heat, so the second ground free from all stains relieves living beings of the mental torment caused by faulty moral discipline.</p>

			<p class="text-heading">HOW THE THIRD GROUND IS ATTAINED</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-802"></a>second ground continues to meditate on emptiness until he or she attains the uninterrupted path that is the direct antidote to middling-big innate true-grasping. This is the <a id="calibre_link-803"></a>uninterrupted path of the second ground. In the next moment he attains the <a id="calibre_link-804"></a>released path that has completely abandoned middling-big <a id="calibre_link-805"></a>innate true-grasping. This is the first moment of the third ground.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DEFINITION OF THE THIRD GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of the <a id="calibre_link-806"></a>third ground is a Superior Bodhisattva’s path that has abandoned middling-big <a id="calibre_link-807"></a>innate true-grasping, its principal object of abandonment, and that has attained a surpassing practice of the perfection of patience from within the ten perfections.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS OF THE THIRD GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-808"></a>third ground has three divisions &ndash; the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the third ground, the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment of the third ground and the exalted awareness of the third ground that is neither of the two. The first has three divisions &ndash; the released path of the third ground, the uninterrupted path of the third ground and the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the third ground that is neither of the two. The first of these occurs at the very beginning of the third ground and the second, which is the direct antidote to small-big innate true-grasping, occurs at the very end. Between these two, the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise that is neither of the two and the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment arise alternately.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">EXPLANATION OF THE THIRD GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The third ground will now be explained under the following four headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The etymology of the ground, the basis of characteristics</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	The good qualities that characterize this ground</p>

			<p class="text-heading">THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE GROUND, THE BASIS OF CHARACTERISTICS</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[III.1] Because there arises the light of the fire</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">That consumes all the fuel of objects of knowledge, this third ground is Luminous.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">At this time there arises for the Sugatas’ Son</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">A copper-like appearance similar to the sun.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-809"></a>third ground attains a powerful wisdom that is like a fire whose light eradicates all elaborations of <a id="calibre_link-810"></a>dualistic appearance during meditative equipoise, and when he rises from meditation he experiences a coppery glow pervading the whole environment, rather like the appearance of the sky just before sunrise. For this reason the third ground is called ‘Luminous’.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITIES THAT CHARACTERIZE THIS GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This section has four parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The surpassing patience on this ground</p>

			<p class="text-heading">THE SURPASSING <a id="calibre_link-811"></a>PATIENCE ON THIS GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[III.2] Even if someone inappropriately angered</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Were to cut flesh and bone from his body</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Piece by piece for a long time,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">He would generate a superior patience towards the mutilator.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[III.3] Furthermore, for the Bodhisattva who has seen selflessness,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">What is cut, by whom, at what time and in what manner </span><span class="bold">&ndash;</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">All these phenomena are seen to be like reflections,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Therefore he is patient.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">To become angry with someone we have to think, ‘He harmed me or my friends in the past’, ‘He is harming us now’, ‘He will harm us in the future’, and so on but since none of these applies to <a id="calibre_link-812"></a>Bodhisattvas who are endowed with great compassion and who never even wish harm towards anyone, Bodhisattvas are inappropriate objects of <a id="calibre_link-813"></a>anger. Even so, if someone out of confusion were to generate anger towards a <a id="calibre_link-814"></a>third-ground Bodhisattva and then, to inflict great pain on him, were slowly to cut flesh and bone from his body in very small pieces, the Bodhisattva would think only of the great suffering his torturer will experience as a result of his action, and out of <a id="calibre_link-815"></a>great compassion generate a superior <a id="calibre_link-816"></a>patience towards him.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Furthermore, because this Bodhisattva has a non-conceptual realization of selflessness he or she sees the <a id="calibre_link-817"></a>three spheres &ndash; what is cut, by whom and at what time and in what manner &ndash; to be completely lacking in inherent existence, just like reflections. Through the force of this realization and his great compassion, his mind is not in the least disturbed by the mutilation of his <a id="calibre_link-818"></a>body and he is able to be supremely patient.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">These verses describe the surpassing practice of the perfection of patience attained by the Bodhisattva on the third ground. The definition of <a id="calibre_link-819"></a><a id="calibre_link-820"></a>perfection of patience is a virtuous determination to forbear harm, suffering or profound Dharma that is maintained by bodhichitta. It has two divisions &ndash; the transcending perfection of patience and the transcendent perfection of patience.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> If <a id="calibre_link-821"></a><a id="calibre_link-822"></a>Bodhisattvas on the first two grounds were to have their bodies mutilated they too would patiently forbear the mutilation, and their minds would remain undisturbed, so why is this given as a quality of the third-ground Bodhisattva?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> The principal reason why ordinary beings cannot bear to have their body cut is their self-cherishing. Bodhisattvas on the first two grounds have completely overcome <a id="calibre_link-823"></a>self-cherishing and so they could remain patient without pain if their bodies were cut. However, they still have <a id="calibre_link-824"></a>imprints of <a id="calibre_link-825"></a>self-cherishing. When a Bodhisattva reaches the third ground he has abandoned both self-cherishing and its imprints and so he is said to possess a surpassing practice of the <a id="calibre_link-826"></a>perfection of patience that is not possessed by Bodhisattvas on the lower grounds.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE WAY TO RELY ON OTHER PATIENCE</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Since patience is an important practice for everyone, not just for Bodhisattvas, Chandrakirti now explains how beings other than Bodhisattvas should avoid anger and practise patience. This explanation is given in two parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The unsuitability of getting angry</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	The suitability of relying on patience</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE UNSUITABILITY OF GETTING ANGRY</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This section has four parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	<a id="calibre_link-827"></a>Anger is unsuitable because it is unnecessary and very faulty</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	Not wishing future suffering and retaliating harmfully are contradictory</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">3	Anger is unsuitable because it destroys virtues previously accumulated over a long time</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">4	Stopping anger having contemplated the many faults of impatience</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ANGER IS UNSUITABLE BECAUSE IT IS UNNECESSARY AND VERY FAULTY</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[III.4] If someone harms us and we become angry,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Does our anger undo what was done?</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Thus getting angry is certainly senseless here</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">And contradictory with the world beyond.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">If someone harms us and we become angry, our anger cannot undo the harm that was done. Although it may seem that anger is justified and that it yields some satisfaction, if we check closely we will see that there is never any point in getting angry. For example, suppose a man called George who has been separated from his family for a long time is travelling home for a family reunion. On the way he encounters an unruly person who says something to upset him and, instead of practising patience and continuing on his way, he answers back and provokes further insult. In such a situation they could easily come to blows and George could well spend his holiday in hospital or even jail rather than with his family. George’s retaliation and anger would have served only to bring unhappiness both to himself and to his family. Anger never brings redress but only adds to our present troubles, and because it causes suffering in future lives it is also contradictory with our wish for future happiness.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">NOT WISHING FUTURE SUFFERING AND RETALIATING HARMFULLY ARE CONTRADICTORY</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[III.5] How can one who wants to assert that he is eradicating</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Through anger and harm towards others?</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">When we are harmed by others we naturally assume that they are the cause of our <a id="calibre_link-828"></a>suffering, but in reality all the harm we experience is the result of <a id="calibre_link-829"></a>non-virtuous actions we have committed in the past. If we want to eradicate such harmful effects we must learn to accept them <a id="calibre_link-830"></a>patiently as the fruits of our own actions. Each time we do so we purify the non-virtue that led to that experience and ensure that it will not affect us again. Patiently accepting harm with a positive mind gradually <a id="calibre_link-831"></a>purifies non-virtue and sows the seeds of future <a id="calibre_link-832"></a>happiness, but retaliating to those who harm us only sows seeds of future <a id="calibre_link-833"></a>suffering. Therefore wishing for happiness in the future and retaliating with anger are contradictory. Seeing this, we should try to prevent anger and always practise patience.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ANGER IS UNSUITABLE BECAUSE IT DESTROYS VIRTUES PREVIOUSLY ACCUMULATED OVER A LONG TIME</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[III.6] Through getting angry with Conquerors’ Sons</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Therefore there is no evil greater than anger.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Through getting angry with Bodhisattvas for just an instant we can destroy virtues arising from actions such as giving and moral discipline that we have accumulated over a hundred aeons. Moreover, such anger will retard our spiritual practice by making it harder for us to attain realizations, and it will condemn us to <a id="calibre_link-834"></a>lower rebirth in the future. Therefore there is no evil greater than anger. Since we do not know who is a Bodhisattva and who is not, we should always take great care to avoid anger.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">In <a id="calibre_link-835"></a><span class="italic">Manjushri Sport Sutra</span> Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Anger destroys virtues accumulated over a hundred aeons.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">and in <a id="calibre_link-836"></a><span class="italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span> Shantideva says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">All the virtuous deeds and merit,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Such as giving and making offerings,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">That we have accumulated over thousands of aeons</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Can be destroyed by just one moment of anger.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Anger either weakens or destroys the potentiality of our <a id="calibre_link-837"></a>virtuous actions to produce beneficial results in the future. For example, the virtuous action of observing pure <a id="calibre_link-838"></a>moral discipline has the potentiality to cause rebirth as a <a id="calibre_link-839"></a>human, but this potentiality may be weakened or destroyed by subsequent anger. The specific effect will depend on the object and the intensity of the anger. Generally, the effects are far worse if the anger is directed at someone who has higher realizations than oneself. Anger directed at Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is the worst of all. Similarly, the effects of strong anger are far worse than the effects of slight anger. For example, if we generate intense anger towards a Bodhisattva or other highly-realized being, the potentiality to produce a human rebirth will be destroyed. Just as a tree whose roots are cut can never produce fruit, so a virtuous action whose roots are severed by anger can never produce a result. However, if we generate only slight anger towards a higher being and immediately generate regret the adverse effects will be considerably less. If our anger is not so intense and is directed at someone with the same realizations as us it will not destroy the potentiality but it will weaken it and postpone the ripening of its effect. If that anger is not purified we will take rebirth in a <a id="calibre_link-840"></a>lower realm and the fruits of observing moral discipline will not ripen until subsequent lives. If we generate only slight anger towards someone who has lower realizations than us the potentiality will be only slightly weakened. For example, we might take a human rebirth in our next life but experience difficulties in gaining spiritual realizations during that life. However, if we repeatedly generate strong anger towards someone with lower realizations without feeling regret this will destroy the potentiality.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[III.7abc] Impatience creates unattractive forms, leads to the unholy,</span></p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">Generally, patience is the cause of beautiful forms and anger the cause of unattractive forms. Whenever we get angry our physical appearance transforms and our face becomes ugly and frowning. We develop an intimidating presence that causes others to avoid us as much as possible. We also sow the seeds to be reborn in an ugly form in the future. Moreover, anger leads us to unholy states by destroying our reputation and diminishing our special qualities. If those who are looked on as <a id="calibre_link-841"></a>holy beings repeatedly get angry they soon cease to command the respect of others and eventually come to be regarded as ordinary beings. In future lives too they will become unholy beings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Anger destroys all our positive minds. For example, it robs us of our ability to discriminate right from wrong. Most of us have the wisdom to know that killing is wrong, but under the influence of anger we can lose this wisdom and take another’s life. All the sufferings that ensue from such actions are the results of anger. Similarly all conflicts in this world from domestic quarrels to world wars arise from anger. Whenever we act out of anger we accumulate negative karma that causes us to take lower rebirth. The sufferings that result from anger in this life are mild compared with the agonies of the <a id="calibre_link-842"></a>lower realms, where the duration of misery is inconceivably long.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">By reflecting on these faults we will come to see that anger is wholly destructive and functions only to cause harm to both ourself and others. We should become convinced of this and make a firm decision always to prevent anger.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">Due to imprints from our past lives we may have a tendency to become angry in certain situations. To counteract this we need to think about the faults of <a id="calibre_link-848"></a>anger repeatedly and keep them in mind all the time. We should regard anger as a poison that has no function other than to harm us. When we feel ourself becoming irritated and on the point of becoming angry we should immediately remember the faults of anger and prevent it from developing. If we always practise in this way our tendency to become angry will gradually diminish and eventually disappear altogether. Then we will have become a person who never gets angry!</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Dharma practitioners may sometimes find anger arising in their minds, but they remember the faults of anger straightaway and try to prevent it from developing further. This is very good because they immediately forget their anger and do not bear a lasting grudge. If we do not check anger as soon as it arises, it quickly takes hold of our mind and turns into a lingering <a id="calibre_link-849"></a>resentment. If possible, we should prevent anger from arising at all, but if it does arise in our mind we must immediately take steps to remove it and prevent it from becoming resentment.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">The <a id="calibre_link-851"></a>third-ground Bodhisattva has many other pure qualities besides patience. He or she attains extraordinary concentration and so has special realizations of the four absorptions of the form realm, the four absorptions of the formless realm, the <a id="calibre_link-852"></a>four <a id="calibre_link-853"></a>immeasurables and the five <a id="calibre_link-854"></a>clairvoyances.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The absorptions of the <a id="calibre_link-855"></a>form and <a id="calibre_link-856"></a>formless realms are often called ‘<a id="calibre_link-857"></a>mundane paths’ because they can lead to rebirth as a form or formless realm god. All <a id="calibre_link-858"></a>samsaric beings live in one of the three realms &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-859"></a>desire realm, the <a id="calibre_link-860"></a>form realm or the <a id="calibre_link-861"></a>formless realm. The desire realm is the grossest of the three realms and has ten levels &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-862"></a>hell realm, the <a id="calibre_link-863"></a>hungry ghost realm, the <a id="calibre_link-864"></a>animal realm, the human realm and the six realms of <a id="calibre_link-865"></a><a id="calibre_link-866"></a>desire realm <a id="calibre_link-867"></a>gods &ndash; Land of the Four Great Kings, <a id="calibre_link-868"></a>Land of the Thirty-three Heavens, Land Without Combat, Joyful Land, Land of Enjoying Emanations and <a id="calibre_link-869"></a>Land of Controlling Emanations. The <a id="calibre_link-870"></a>desire realm is so called because the beings who inhabit it are afflicted with gross desirous attachment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Compared with the desire realm, the form and formless realms are very pure and peaceful. The <a id="calibre_link-871"></a><a id="calibre_link-872"></a>form realm has four levels &ndash; the first form realm, the second form realm, the third form realm and the fourth form realm. Within these, the first form realm has three levels &ndash; <a id="calibre_link-873"></a>Brahma Class, Attending Brahma and Great Brahma. The principal being of the first form realm is the god Brahma. He resides in the Great Brahma level and reigns over the two realms beneath him. The second form realm has three levels &ndash; Little Light, Immeasurable Light and Clear Light. These are named after the amount of light that the gods radiate. The third form realm has three levels &ndash; Little Virtue, Immeasurable Virtue and Extensive Virtue. These are named after the degree of bliss experienced by the gods who inhabit them. The fourth form realm has eight levels &ndash; Cloudless, Born from Merit, Great Result, Not Great, Without Pain, Excellent Appearance, Great Seeing and None Higher. The first three are places of rebirth of ordinary beings and the last five are places of rebirth of Hinayana <a id="calibre_link-874"></a>Superiors. Cloudless is so called because the gods who inhabit it are free from the clouds of the grosser level of bliss experienced by the gods of the third form realm, Born from Merit is so called because rebirth here is the result of great merit and Great Result is so called because it is the highest state ordinary beings can attain by depending on <a id="calibre_link-875"></a>form realm absorptions. The <a id="calibre_link-876"></a>long-life gods mentioned in the <a id="calibre_link-877"></a>Lamrim teachings on the eight unfree states live on this level. The remaining five levels are known as the ‘five <a id="calibre_link-878"></a>Pure Lands’. When Hinayana <a id="calibre_link-879"></a>Foe Destroyers die they often choose to be born in one of these Lands where they can remain at peace for as long as they wish. These Pure Lands are beyond samsara, but they are not Buddha Lands. The <a id="calibre_link-880"></a>form realm is so called because the gods who inhabit it have subtle form aggregates.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The <a id="calibre_link-881"></a>formless realm has four levels &ndash; infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness and <a id="calibre_link-882"></a>peak of samsara. The last of these is the highest state within samsara. The <a id="calibre_link-883"></a>formless realm is so called because the gods who inhabit it lack the aggregate of form. The various levels of the form and formless realms are differentiated by the level of concentration of the beings who inhabit them.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The gods who live in the form and <a id="calibre_link-884"></a>formless realms have no gross <a id="calibre_link-885"></a>delusions such as anger, jealousy or attachment to external objects. They do not depend on external conditions such as food and clothing, although form realm gods do abide in beautiful celestial mansions that appear spontaneously when they are born. Since they are not born from a womb they do not experience the sufferings of birth and since they do not have gross bodies they do not experience the sufferings of <a id="calibre_link-886"></a>sickness, ageing and death experienced by beings in the <a id="calibre_link-887"></a>desire realm. Many non-Buddhists regard rebirth as a form or formless realm god as a state of liberation. In reality, however, these gods are still trapped in the prison of samsara and when the karma for them to enjoy that rebirth is exhausted they die and fall back to the lower realms.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Bodhisattvas understand that there is no lasting benefit in being reborn in the form and formless realms. However, they still strive to attain the form and formless realm absorptions. These are powerful, blissful minds that are always conjoined with mental <a id="calibre_link-888"></a>suppleness. Meditation on emptiness with a <a id="calibre_link-889"></a>form or formless realm absorption is much more powerful than it is with a desire realm mind because these minds readily mix with emptiness making it much easier to overcome <a id="calibre_link-890"></a>dualistic appearance. When used in this way, these absorptions are not <a id="calibre_link-891"></a>mundane paths that lead to rebirth as a samsaric god but <a id="calibre_link-892"></a>supramundane paths that lead to liberation and enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The four absorptions of the <a id="calibre_link-893"></a>form realm are known as the first mental stabilization, the second mental stabilization, the third mental stabilization and the fourth mental stabilization, and the four absorptions of the <a id="calibre_link-894"></a>formless realm are known as the absorption of infinite space, the absorption of infinite consciousness, the absorption of nothingness and the absorption of peak of samsara. These absorptions are attained by abandoning progressively more and more subtle levels of delusion.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The <a id="calibre_link-895"></a>desire realm, the four <a id="calibre_link-896"></a>form realms and the four <a id="calibre_link-897"></a>formless realms each have nine levels of <a id="calibre_link-898"></a><a id="calibre_link-899"></a><a id="calibre_link-900"></a>delusion, making eighty-one levels of delusion in all. The nine levels of delusion of the desire realm are big-big, middling-big, small-big, big-middling, middling-middling, small-middling, big-small, middling-small and small-small. The nine levels of delusion of each of the four form realms and four formless realms are named in a similar way. To attain the actual absorption of the first mental stabilization we have to abandon the nine levels of delusion of the desire realm, to attain the actual absorption of the second mental stabilization we have to abandon the nine levels of delusion of the first form realm and so on. It should be noted however that by training in mundane paths we can abandon only manifest delusions, that is we can temporarily prevent the delusions from becoming manifest, but we cannot eradicate them altogether by destroying their seeds. To do this we must train in supramundane paths.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">To attain the actual absorption of the first mental stabilization of the form realm we first need to train in the absorption of close preparation of the first mental stabilization. When we attain <a id="calibre_link-901"></a>tranquil abiding we attain the absorption of close preparation of the first mental stabilization of a beginner, which is a form realm mind that has not yet attained <a id="calibre_link-902"></a>superior seeing. Then, with the determination to abandon the delusions of the desire realm, we need to train in the absorption of close preparation that overcomes delusions. This has six stages, which are known as the ‘<a id="calibre_link-903"></a>six attentions’. They are:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	Attention cognizing specific characteristics</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(2)	Attention of belief</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(3)	Attention of complete isolation</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(4)	Attention of gathering joy</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(5)	Attention of analysis</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-last">(6)	Attention of the conclusion of training</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The first of these is a special type of wisdom. After attaining <a id="calibre_link-904"></a>tranquil abiding, a Yogi or Yogini who wishes to attain the actual absorption of the first mental stabilization engages in analytical <a id="calibre_link-905"></a>meditation on the faults of the desire realm and the advantages of the form realm. This is the main cause of attaining superior seeing. Although at this stage the Yogi possesses tranquil abiding he cannot maintain it while he is doing this analysis. Previously he accomplished tranquil abiding by fixing his mind on a stationary object. Now he has to train in the<a id="calibre_link-906"></a> nine mental abidings, overcoming the five obstacles by applying the eight opponents, while his mind is engaged in analysis.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">First he or she brings to mind the object, the faults of the desire realm and the advantages of the form realm. This is the first mental abiding. Then he trains principally in improving his <a id="calibre_link-907"></a>mindfulness until he reaches the point where he never forgets the object throughout the entire session, irrespective of whether he is engaged in placement meditation or analytical meditation. This is the fourth mental abiding. Then he must strive to eliminate the faults of subtle mental sinking and subtle mental excitement. The latter are particularly difficult to overcome because the activity of analyzing can easily disturb the stability of concentration. Eventually, however, the Yogi reaches the point where he can maintain effortless, spontaneous concentration while analyzing the faults of the desire realm and the advantages of the form realm. This is the ninth mental abiding.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Through continuing to alternate between analytical meditation and placement meditation, eventually he attains a special mental and physical <a id="calibre_link-908"></a>suppleness induced by analysis. Previously, the stability of his placement meditation slightly hindered his analytical meditation and the movement of his analytical meditation disturbed the stability of his placement meditation. Now he is able both to analyze the object without disturbing the stability of his concentration and concentrate on the object without impeding his analysis. When he attains this special suppleness induced by analysis he attains <a id="calibre_link-909"></a>superior seeing, and his attention cognizing specific characteristics transforms into the attention of belief.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The attention of belief is so called because as a result of the previous analysis it strongly believes the desire realm to be faulty and the form realm to be peaceful. The attention of belief is by nature superior seeing. When the attention of belief becomes powerful enough to function as the direct antidote to the big-big desire realm delusions it transforms into the attention of complete isolation, which is so called because it completely isolates the mind from the grossest level of manifest desire realm delusions. This attention is also the nature of superior seeing. There are six stages to this attention:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	Attention of complete isolation that is the direct antidote to big-big desire realm delusions</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(2)	Attention of complete isolation that is completely released from big-big desire realm delusions</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(3)	Attention of complete isolation that is the direct antidote to middling-big desire realm delusions</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(4)	Attention of complete isolation that is completely released from middling-big desire realm delusions</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(5)	Attention of complete isolation that is the direct antidote to small-big desire realm delusions</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-last">(6)	Attention of complete isolation that is completely released from small-big desire realm delusions</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The first, third and fifth are <a id="calibre_link-910"></a>uninterrupted paths; and the second, fourth and sixth are <a id="calibre_link-911"></a>released paths. The Yogi attains the first two in the same session and then alternates between the practices of <a id="calibre_link-912"></a>subsequent attainment and meditative equipoise until his meditation is powerful enough to function as the direct antidote to the middling-big <a id="calibre_link-913"></a>desire realm <a id="calibre_link-914"></a>delusions. With this he attains the third attention of complete isolation and so on.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Having attained release from the three levels of big desire realm delusion, the Yogi now strives to abandon the three levels of middling desire realm delusion. When his meditation is powerful enough to function as the direct antidote to the big-middling desire realm delusions, his attention of complete isolation transforms into the attention of gathering joy. This has six stages, similar to the six stages of the attention of complete isolation, which abandon the three levels of middling desire realm delusion.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">When the Yogi attains release from the small-middling desire realm delusions he feels as if he has abandoned all delusions. Objects that used to provoke anger, jealousy or attachment no longer stimulate any delusions and he feels as if he could not generate delusions even if he tried. However, when he returns to his meditation and closely examines his mind he realizes that he still has subtle levels of desire realm delusion within his continuum. He then determines to abandon these. This process of analysis and determination, which is done with the wisdom of superior seeing and the concentration of tranquil abiding, is the attention of analysis.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">When this attention becomes powerful enough to function as the direct antidote to the big-small desire realm delusions it transforms into the attention of the conclusion of training. This has five stages, which correspond to the first five stages of the attentions of complete isolation and gathering joy. The first, third and fifth stages are <a id="calibre_link-915"></a>uninterrupted paths that are the direct antidotes to big-small, middling-small and small-small desire realm delusions respectively. The second and fourth stages are <a id="calibre_link-916"></a>released paths that have abandoned big-small and middling-small desire realm delusions respectively. The released path that has abandoned small-small desire realm delusions is the actual absorption of the first mental stabilization.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The stages of accomplishing the actual absorption of the first mental stabilization are similar to the stages of the five supramundane paths. The initial attainment of the absorption of close preparation of the first mental stabilization of a beginner is like a <a id="calibre_link-917"></a>mundane path of accumulation. It is not an actual path of accumulation but it performs a similar function. The attention cognizing specific characteristics is like a mundane path of preparation and the attention of belief is like a mundane path of seeing. Just as on the actual path of seeing the wisdom realizing emptiness is not yet powerful enough to function as the direct antidote to innate delusions so on the mundane path of seeing the superior seeing observing the faults of the desire realm and the advantages of the form realm is not yet powerful enough to function as the direct antidote to the big-big delusions of the desire realm. When the attention of belief transforms into the attention of complete isolation this is like entering the mundane path of meditation. On the actual path of meditation the innate delusions are abandoned level by level by the wisdom realizing selflessness and on the mundane path of meditation the manifest delusions of the desire realm are abandoned in a similar way by the last four attentions. When the small-small desire realm delusions have been abandoned the Yogi attains the actual absorption of the first mental stabilization, which is like a mundane path of No More Learning.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The actual absorption of the first mental stabilization is a far purer, more peaceful and more stable mind than the absorption of close preparation of the first mental stabilization. Unless he or she goes on to develop higher absorptions or is motivated by renunciation or bodhichitta a Yogi who has attained the actual absorption of the first mental stabilization will definitely be reborn in the first form realm in his or her next life. This is because he no longer has the cause to be reborn in the desire realm but has not yet created the cause to be reborn in the second form realm or higher. Since he has no manifest desire realm delusions he cannot generate dependent-related craving and grasping for the desire realm. Instead he develops a subtle type of attachment for the first <a id="calibre_link-918"></a>form realm, which functions as the dependent-related links of <a id="calibre_link-919"></a>craving and <a id="calibre_link-920"></a>grasping. These serve to ripen the potentialities that cause rebirth in the first form realm.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">To attain the actual absorption of the second mental stabilization of the form realm, the Yogi meditates on the absorption of close preparation of the second mental stabilization. He meditates on the grossness of the first form realm compared with the peacefulness of the second form realm and generates a determination to abandon the nine levels of <a id="calibre_link-921"></a>delusion of the first form realm by applying the six attentions. These attentions are similar to those of the first mental stabilization except that at this level they function to abandon the delusions of the first form realm instead of the delusions of the desire realm. When the attention of the conclusion of training of the second mental stabilization has abandoned the small-small delusions of the first form realm the Yogi attains the actual absorption of the second mental stabilization. The way to attain the actual absorptions of the third and fourth mental stabilizations of the form realm can be understood from this explanation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The <a id="calibre_link-922"></a>formless realm is higher than the <a id="calibre_link-923"></a>form realm from the point of view of peacefulness, purity and absence of distracting thoughts. Both ordinary beings and Hinayana Superiors can take rebirth there but Bodhisattvas do not. Formless realm beings lack physical bodies and do not have sense powers so they have no opportunity to listen to Dharma teachings or to communicate with others. Since the only reason Bodhisattvas take <a id="calibre_link-924"></a>rebirth in the abodes of samsara is to benefit living beings, there is no reason for them to take rebirth in a realm where they cannot communicate with its inhabitants. However, Bodhisattvas strive to accomplish the formless realm absorptions because they are extremely subtle and powerful states of mind that allow them to attain deep absorption on emptiness free from gross conceptual distraction.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">As mentioned before, there are four actual absorptions of the <a id="calibre_link-925"></a>formless realm:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	The absorption of infinite space</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(2)	The absorption of infinite consciousness</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(3)	The absorption of nothingness</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-last">(4)	The absorption of <a id="calibre_link-926"></a>peak of samsara</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The way to attain these four absorptions is similar to the way to attain the four absorptions of the form realm. Thus, to attain the actual absorption of infinite space the Yogi must abandon the nine levels of <a id="calibre_link-927"></a>delusion of the fourth <a id="calibre_link-928"></a>form realm by training in the absorption of close preparation of infinite space. Seeing that many problems arise from attachment to forms the Yogi develops a determination to attain a state of formlessness. With this motivation he meditates on <a id="calibre_link-929"></a>unproduced space, the mere absence of form, until he attains tranquil abiding on this object. This is the absorption of close preparation of infinite space of a beginner. Then, with tranquil abiding, he analyzes the faults of form and the good qualities of formlessness. This is the attention cognizing specific characteristics. When he develops the bliss of suppleness arisen from this analysis he attains the attention of belief and when this is able to function as the direct antidote to big-big delusions of the fourth form realm he attains the attention of complete isolation. As with the attention of complete isolation of the form realms, this attention also has six stages &ndash; the three <a id="calibre_link-930"></a>uninterrupted paths that are the direct antidotes to the three levels of big delusion of the fourth form realm and the three <a id="calibre_link-931"></a>released paths that have abandoned these delusions. When the attention of complete isolation becomes powerful enough to function as the direct antidote to the big-middling delusions of the fourth form realm it transforms into the attention of gathering joy. After completing this attention the Yogi then analyzes his mind with the attention of analysis and realizes that small delusions of the fourth form realm still remain in his mental continuum. To abandon these he continues to meditate on the union of tranquil abiding and superior seeing observing the vacuity of infinite space until his meditation becomes powerful enough to function as the direct antidote to the big-small delusions of the fourth form realm. At this point he attains the attention of the conclusion of training. Again, this has five stages &ndash; three <a id="calibre_link-932"></a>uninterrupted paths and two released paths. The <a id="calibre_link-933"></a>released path that has abandoned small-small delusions of the fourth form realm is the actual absorption of infinite space.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">To attain the actual absorption of infinite consciousness the Yogi contemplates the relative grossness of infinite space and subtlety of infinite consciousness. Then concentrating on the infinity of consciousness he completes the stages of the absorption of close preparation of infinite consciousness, which are similar to those already explained except that at this level they function to abandon the nine levels of <a id="calibre_link-934"></a>delusion of the first <a id="calibre_link-935"></a>formless realm. To attain the actual absorption of nothingness the Yogi considers the appearance of consciousness to be gross and meditates on nothingness. Progressing through the same stages as before he gradually abandons the nine levels of delusion of the second formless realm and attains the actual absorption of nothingness. To attain the actual absorption of <a id="calibre_link-936"></a>peak of samsara the Yogi considers the discrimination of nothingness to be a gross discrimination, and he develops a wish to abandon all gross discriminations and remain only in a state of subtle consciousness. Then by concentrating on the cessation of gross discrimination he gradually abandons the nine levels of delusion of the third formless realm and attains the actual absorption of peak of samsara.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Peak of samsara also has nine levels of delusion, from big-big to small-small. It is possible to abandon the first eight levels by following only <a id="calibre_link-937"></a>mundane paths and many non-Buddhist meditators have done so. However, to abandon the small-small delusions of peak of samsara and thereby attain liberation it is necessary to meditate on <a id="calibre_link-938"></a>supramundane paths, or paths that are conjoined with a direct realization of emptiness. These paths are found only within the Buddhist system.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">A Yogi who has attained the mundane path of the absorption of peak of samsara in a human body can progress further by generating renunciation and entering the path to liberation, but a person who has taken <a id="calibre_link-939"></a>rebirth in the realm of peak of samsara has no such opportunity. All he can do is abide in a state of subtle consciousness with no mental activity until his karma for remaining in that state is exhausted. Then, with his stock of merit depleted, he dies and falls back to lower realms. The mundane path of peak of samsara only temporarily abandons the eighty levels of delusion. Because the seeds of these delusions remain, the delusions themselves eventually manifest again.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In summary, the eight absorptions of close preparation and the eight actual absorptions of the <a id="calibre_link-940"></a>form and <a id="calibre_link-941"></a>formless realms can be either mundane or supramundane paths. Any absorption that is not motivated by <a id="calibre_link-942"></a>renunciation or bodhichitta is a mundane path and a cause of rebirth in samsara. Many non-Buddhists understand the faults of the desire realm and the good qualities of the upper realms but they do not understand pervasive <a id="calibre_link-943"></a>suffering and so they cannot develop renunciation for all three realms of samsara. Some regard the form realm absorptions as the ultimate attainment while others see them as a step on the way to the higher absorptions of the formless realm, which they consider to be real liberation. From a Buddhist point of view, however, rebirth as a <a id="calibre_link-944"></a>god of the <a id="calibre_link-945"></a><a id="calibre_link-946"></a>form or <a id="calibre_link-947"></a>formless realm is not a step on the way to liberation but an obstacle to attaining liberation. Generally, form and formless realm gods cannot develop renunciation or bodhichitta nor identify the object of negation of emptiness. For this reason, those who seek liberation or enlightenment pray not to be reborn in these realms.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Although Bodhisattvas have no wish to take rebirth in the upper realms they do nevertheless strive to attain the form and formless realm absorptions. From the great stage of the <a id="calibre_link-948"></a>path of accumulation onwards Bodhisattvas meditate on emptiness with actual form or formless realm absorptions but because of the strength of their bodhichitta motivation these absorptions do not cause rebirth in the upper realms. For Bodhisattvas, the form and formless realm absorptions are causes of enlightenment and are therefore supramundane paths. The definitions of the absorptions of the form and formless realms are given below in the section on the emptiness of definitions (<a href="#calibre_link-77"><span class="hyperlink">see here</span></a>).</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Besides special realizations of the form and formless realm absorptions, the Bodhisattva on the third ground also has special realizations of the <a id="calibre_link-949"></a>four <a id="calibre_link-950"></a>immeasurables and the five clairvoyances. The four immeasurables are immeasurable love, immeasurable compassion, immeasurable joy and immeasurable equanimity. Immeasurable love is a mind attained in dependence on a concentration that wishes immeasurable living beings to experience happiness. Within the three kinds of <a id="calibre_link-951"></a>love &ndash; affectionate love, cherishing love and wishing love &ndash; immeasurable love is necessarily wishing love. Immeasurable compassion is a mind attained in dependence on a concentration that wishes immeasurable living beings to be free from suffering. Immeasurable joy is a mind attained in dependence on a concentration that wishes immeasurable living beings never to be separated from happiness. Immeasurable equanimity is a mind attained in dependence on a concentration that wishes immeasurable living beings to be free from attachment and hatred.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Each of the four immeasurables is generated in dependence on four causes &ndash; the seed, the observed object, the dominant condition and the immediate condition. The seed of a particular mind is the potentiality for that mind. Every living being has the seeds of the four immeasurables in their mental continuum, which are the main causes of the four immeasurables. When, for example, the seed of immeasurable love within our continuum meets with the other three causes immeasurable love is generated. The observed object of immeasurable love is immeasurable living beings who are seen to be without real happiness. The observed object of immeasurable compassion is immeasurable living beings who are seen to be experiencing suffering. The observed object of immeasurable joy is immeasurable living beings who are seen to be experiencing only limited happiness. The observed object of immeasurable equanimity is immeasurable living beings who are seen to be experiencing unending problems and suffering as a result of their attachment and hatred. The dominant condition of each of the four immeasurables is the Spiritual Guide who teaches us how to generate that mind. These special minds never arise naturally but have to be cultivated by following the instructions of a qualified Spiritual Guide. The immediate condition of each of the four immeasurables is the mind that directly induces it.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Each of the four immeasurables has a threefold division. For example, immeasurable love is divided into immeasurable love observing mere living beings, immeasurable love observing phenomena and immeasurable love observing the unobservable. These can be understood from the explanation of the three types of compassion given above. The definitions of the four immeasurables are given below, in the section on the emptiness of definitions (<a href="#calibre_link-78"><span class="hyperlink">see here</span></a>).</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-952"></a>clairvoyance is a mind that directly apprehends its object through the power of an actual form realm absorption that is its uncommon dominant condition. There are five <a id="calibre_link-953"></a>clairvoyances &ndash; the clairvoyance of miracle powers, the clairvoyance of divine ear, the clairvoyance of knowing others’ minds, the clairvoyance of knowing previous lives and the clairvoyance of divine eye. These are of great help to Bodhisattvas in their work to benefit all living beings. In <a id="calibre_link-954"></a><span class="italic">Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment</span> <a id="calibre_link-955"></a>Atisha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">Just as a bird without wings cannot fly, so those who lack clairvoyance cannot benefit living beings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-956"></a>clairvoyance of miracle powers is a clairvoyance that can produce magical transformations in dependence on an actual form realm absorption that is its uncommon dominant condition. Examples are concentrations that can transform one object into many or many into one, make small objects large or large objects small, or enable one to walk on air or through the earth. Because in these impure times beings have little merit and little wisdom, Bodhisattvas no longer make public displays of their miracle powers in case they prove counter-productive, but in the past they used such powers to inspire faith in others.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of clairvoyance of divine ear is a clairvoyance that directly hears gross and subtle sounds in dependence on an actual form realm absorption that is its uncommon dominant condition. Examples are mental direct perceivers that directly hear distant sounds and subtle inner sounds that are beyond the range of ordinary hearing. Bodhisattvas use this clairvoyance to know the speech of others so that they can give appropriate advice.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of clairvoyance of knowing others’ minds is a clairvoyance that directly knows the minds of others in dependence on an actual form realm absorption that is its uncommon dominant condition. An example is a mental direct perceiver that directly perceives another’s thoughts or feelings. Bodhisattvas use this clairvoyance to help them give appropriate teachings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of clairvoyance of knowing previous lives is a clairvoyance that directly knows one’s own and others’ previous lives and abodes in dependence on an actual form realm absorption that is its uncommon dominant condition. An example is <a id="calibre_link-957"></a>Atisha’s clairvoyance knowing the previous lives of himself, <a id="calibre_link-958"></a>Dromtonpa and his other Tibetan disciples. On the basis of this knowledge he gave special teachings that became known as the <a id="calibre_link-959"></a><span class="italic">Kadam Dharma of the Father</span> and the <a id="calibre_link-960"></a><span class="italic">Kadam Dharma of the Sons</span>. Bodhisattvas use this clairvoyance to increase the range of experience from which they can draw when they teach or meditate.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The definition of clairvoyance of divine eye is a clairvoyance that directly sees distant forms and subtle forms in dependence on an actual form realm absorption that is its uncommon dominant condition. Examples are mental direct perceivers that directly see gross and subtle forms that are beyond the range of ordinary vision. Bodhisattvas use this clairvoyance to locate beings who need help.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> Since <a id="calibre_link-961"></a><a id="calibre_link-962"></a>Bodhisattvas on the first two grounds also have all these realizations why are they given as qualities of the third-ground Bodhisattva?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> Because the <a id="calibre_link-963"></a>third-ground Bodhisattva has attained an outstanding training in higher concentration, his or her mental stabilizations, absorptions and so forth are much more powerful than those of Bodhisattvas on the lower grounds. Through the force of this concentration he is able to eradicate attachment, hatred, confusion and all the other delusions that arise from middling-big innate true-grasping. He also has great skill in overcoming the desirous attachment and other <a id="calibre_link-964"></a>delusions of worldly beings because he has the confidence and power to guide them into correct paths.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRST THREE PERFECTIONS</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle"><span class="bold">[III.12] These three Dharmas, giving and so forth,</span></p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle"><span class="bold">Are especially praised by the Sugatas for lay people.</span></p>

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last"><span class="bold">The cause of a Buddha’s Body that is the nature of form.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Although the first three <a id="calibre_link-965"></a>perfections are practised by both lay and ordained Bodhisattvas, Buddha praised them as being especially suited to the lifestyle of lay Bodhisattvas. The perfections of effort, mental stabilization and wisdom, on the other hand, were praised as being more suited to the lifestyle of ordained Bodhisattvas.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The first three perfections are also known as the ‘<a id="calibre_link-966"></a>collection of <a id="calibre_link-967"></a>merit’ because they are the main causes of the <a id="calibre_link-968"></a>Form Body of a Buddha. The perfections of mental stabilization and wisdom are known as the ‘<a id="calibre_link-969"></a>collection of <a id="calibre_link-970"></a>wisdom’ because they are the main causes of the <a id="calibre_link-971"></a>Truth Body of a Buddha. The fourth perfection, the perfection of effort, is equally a cause of both bodies. Thus all six perfections are included within the two collections. When ten perfections are enumerated, the last four are included within the sixth, the perfection of wisdom, and thus within the collection of wisdom.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">CONCLUSION BY WAY OF EXPRESSING THE GOOD QUALITIES OF THE GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[III.13] This Luminous, abiding in the sun, the Conquerors’ Son,</span></p>

Because the Bodhisattva’s wisdom is very sharp and as clear as the sun it is impossible for him to lose his patience with faulty beings and so he never gets angry.</p>

			<p class="text-heading">HOW THE FOURTH GROUND IS ATTAINED</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-979"></a>third ground continues to meditate on emptiness until he or she attains the uninterrupted path that is the direct antidote to small-big innate true-grasping. This is the <a id="calibre_link-980"></a>uninterrupted path of the third ground. In the next moment he attains the <a id="calibre_link-981"></a>released path that has completely abandoned small-big <a id="calibre_link-982"></a>innate true-grasping. This is the first moment of the fourth ground.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DEFINITION OF THE FOURTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of the <a id="calibre_link-983"></a>fourth ground is a Superior Bodhisattva’s path that has abandoned small-big innate true-grasping, its principal object of abandonment, and that has attained a surpassing practice of the perfection of effort from within the ten perfections.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS OF THE FOURTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-984"></a>fourth ground has three divisions &ndash; the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the fourth ground, the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment of the fourth ground and the exalted awareness of the fourth ground that is neither of the two. The first has three divisions &ndash; the released path of the fourth ground, the uninterrupted path of the fourth ground and the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the fourth ground that is neither of the two. The first of these occurs at the very beginning of the fourth ground and the second, which is the direct antidote to big-middling innate true-grasping, occurs at the very end. Between these two, the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise that is neither of the two and the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment arise alternately.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">EXPLANATION OF THE FOURTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The fourth ground will now be explained under the following three headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The surpassing effort on this ground</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	The etymology of this ground</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">3	The characteristics of abandonment</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE SURPASSING EFFORT ON THIS <a id="calibre_link-985"></a>GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[IV.1] All good qualities follow from </span><span class="bold"><a id="calibre_link-986"></a></span><span class="bold">effort,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">The cause of the two collections of merit and wisdom.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">The ground on which effort blazes</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Is the fourth, Radiant.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The definition of effort is a virtuous mind that delights in virtue. Thus, in <a id="calibre_link-987"></a><span class="italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span> Shantideva says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Effort is a mind that delights in virtue.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Effort is not simply exertion because it is necessarily a virtuous mind and not all exertion is virtuous. An energetic preoccupation with mundane activities, for example, blocks the mind from engaging in virtue and so is a form of laziness. According to Dharma, a mind that is not happy to engage in virtuous actions is <a id="calibre_link-988"></a>laziness. Laziness closes the door to spiritual attainments.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">For those who practise effort no goal is unattainable. If we have effort we will happily engage in practices such as giving, moral discipline and patience. We will strive enthusiastically to attain spiritual realizations and eventually we will attain the causal and resultant grounds. Listening to teachings, understanding their meaning and gaining experience of them in meditation all depend on <a id="calibre_link-989"></a>effort. Similarly, all the attainments of the grounds and paths, including the final attainment of Buddhahood depend on effort. Therefore, it is said that all good qualities follow from effort. Moreover, effort is the cause of the two <a id="calibre_link-990"></a><a id="calibre_link-991"></a>collections of <a id="calibre_link-992"></a>merit and <a id="calibre_link-993"></a>wisdom, which themselves are the principal <a id="calibre_link-994"></a>causes of the two <a id="calibre_link-995"></a>bodies of a Buddha.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The <a id="calibre_link-996"></a>Bodhisattva on the third ground attained a meditative concentration that surpassed that of the first two grounds. Now as a result of that concentration the Bodhisattva on the fourth ground attains a special mental <a id="calibre_link-997"></a>suppleness that is not attained by Bodhisattvas on the three preceding grounds. Through the force of this suppleness he eliminates all traces of laziness from his mind and so his practice of the perfection of effort becomes surpassing.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-998"></a><a id="calibre_link-999"></a>perfection of effort is any effort maintained by bodhichitta. It has two divisions &ndash; the transcending perfection of effort and the transcendent perfection of effort.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE ETYMOLOGY OF THIS GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[IV.2abc] There, for the Sugatas’ Son,</span></p>

This causes the fire of his wisdom to blaze more strongly and as a result he experiences a radiant appearance that is even more powerful than the coppery glow experienced on the third ground.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Generally, <a id="calibre_link-1002"></a>Hearers, Solitary Realizers and <a id="calibre_link-1003"></a>Mahayanists all practise the thirty-seven realizations conducive to enlightenment but they practise them at different levels and accomplish different results.

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	Four <a id="calibre_link-1008"></a>close placements of <a id="calibre_link-1009"></a>mindfulness</p>

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(6)	Seven branches of enlightenment</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-last">(7)	Eight branches of superior paths</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The definitions of the thirty-seven realizations are given below in the section on the emptiness of definitions (<a href="#calibre_link-80"><span class="hyperlink">see here</span></a>). What follows is a brief explanation of how Bodhisattvas train in these practices.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">A close placement of mindfulness is a path of concentration that depends on mindfulness and wisdom. There are four types &ndash; close placement of mindfulness of body, close placement of mindfulness of feelings, close placement of mindfulness of mind and close placement of mindfulness of phenomena. The first observes the common and uncommon aspects of the body such as its impermanence and emptiness, the second observes the common and uncommon aspects of pleasant, unpleasant and neutral feelings, the third observes the common and uncommon aspects of primary minds and all mental factors other than feelings, and the fourth observes the common and uncommon aspects of phenomena other than body, feelings and mind. The Bodhisattva trains in these practices principally on the small stage of the <a id="calibre_link-1010"></a>path of accumulation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">A <a id="calibre_link-1011"></a>correct abandoner is a special type of effort that delights in abandoning objects of abandonment by means of opponents. There are four types &ndash; correct abandoners that abandon non-virtues already generated, correct abandoners that do not generate non-virtues not yet generated, correct abandoners that increase virtues already generated and correct abandoners that generate virtues not yet generated. The last two are called ‘abandoners’ because to practise any virtue we need to abandon its opposite. Within the <a id="calibre_link-1012"></a>four opponent powers the first correct abandoner is the power of regret, the second is the power of promise and the third and fourth are included within the power of reliance and the power of the opponent force. The Bodhisattva trains in these practices principally on the middling stage of the <a id="calibre_link-1013"></a>path of accumulation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">A <a id="calibre_link-1014"></a>leg of <a id="calibre_link-1015"></a>miracle powers is a path of concentration possessing the eight opponents to the five obstacles that principally functions as a cause of miracle powers. They are called ‘legs’ because they are causes of miracle powers and because they enable the practitioner to travel to places and accomplish deeds beyond the reach and imagination of ordinary beings. There are four types of leg of miracle powers &ndash; those developed through aspiration, effort, mind and analysis. The first type exists in those who already have strong concentration and wisdom. Simply by focusing on the observed object of a particular type of miracle power and developing the aspiration to display that power they can induce the concentration that is the miracle leg. The second type is induced through the force of effort, the third through the force of imprints from previous lives and the fourth through the force of analytical meditation on instructions given by others. The Bodhisattva trains in these practices principally on the great stage of the path of accumulation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are many types of miracle power such as the ability to manifest one body as many or many bodies as one, the ability to fly, and the ability to manifest cities and islands, but it is very difficult for ordinary beings to recognize such <a id="calibre_link-1016"></a>emanations. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are able to produce countless emanations for the sake of living beings. They can manifest inanimate objects such as houses, food, cities and even entire worlds as well as animate objects such as animals or even Spiritual Teachers but unless we have purified our mind we cannot recognize these as emanations.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">All the while we believe things exist from their own side, independent of the mind, we will find it difficult to understand how, for example, <a id="calibre_link-1017"></a>Milarepa could transform himself into a flower. To understand these things we must first realize that all phenomena are like <a id="calibre_link-1018"></a>dreams and do not exist in the least from their own side. If we understand that the world and everything in it arise from mind we will not find it difficult to understand how Yogis and Yoginis who have brought their minds under control can manifest whatever they wish through the power of their concentration.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The five powers are more accurately known as the ‘five <a id="calibre_link-1019"></a>powers of the path’. In this context, a power is a path held by the wisdom of superior seeing observing emptiness that is an uncommon cause of superior paths. There are five types &ndash; the powers of faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom. The power of faith observes great enlightenment and wishes to attain it, the power of effort strives to engage in all the vast and profound paths of the Mahayana, the power of mindfulness observes and retains extensive Mahayana teachings, and the powers of concentration and wisdom observe profound emptiness. The Bodhisattva trains in these practices principally on the first two stages of the <a id="calibre_link-1020"></a><a id="calibre_link-1021"></a>path of preparation &ndash; heat and peak.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The <a id="calibre_link-1022"></a>five forces, or more accurately the ‘five forces of the path’, are paths that have conquered their opposing faults. There are five types &ndash; the forces of faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom. We can understand these by applying them to a particular practice. For example, if we accomplish the five forces of the path with respect to <a id="calibre_link-1023"></a>meditation on emptiness, the force of faith is a faith that has conquered non-faith in emptiness, the force of effort is an effort that has conquered the three types of laziness that make us dislike meditating on emptiness, the force of mindfulness is a mindfulness that has conquered forgetfulness of emptiness, the force of concentration is a concentration that has conquered the five obstacles to perfect concentration on emptiness and the force of wisdom is a wisdom that has destroyed all misunderstandings of the meaning of emptiness. The Bodhisattva trains in these practices principally on the second two stages of the <a id="calibre_link-1024"></a><a id="calibre_link-1025"></a>path of preparation &ndash; patience and supreme Dharma.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">A <a id="calibre_link-1026"></a>branch of enlightenment is a superior path that causes the attainment of enlightenment. There are seven types &ndash; the branches of enlightenment of correct mindfulness, correct wisdom, correct effort, correct joy, correct suppleness, correct concentration and correct equanimity.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In <a id="calibre_link-1027"></a><span class="italic">Ornament for Mahayana Sutras</span> Maitreya describes the seven branches of enlightenment metaphorically as the seven treasures of a <a id="calibre_link-1028"></a>chakravatin king. In previous ages there were kings who ruled over the entire world and brought peace, harmony and prosperity to everyone. Most chakravatin kings were emanations of high Bodhisattvas who deliberately took rebirth in that position to benefit living beings. Chakravatin kings no longer exist in this world because the beings alive now do not have sufficient merit to be ruled by one, but they still exist in other worlds. When a chakravatin king ascends to the throne, seven treasures spontaneously appear through the power of his merit &ndash; a precious wheel, a precious elephant, a precious horse, a precious jewel, a precious queen, a precious minister and a precious general or precious householder. These are described in detail in the book <a id="calibre_link-1029"></a><span class="italic">Great Treasury of Merit</span>. The branch of enlightenment of correct mindfulness is like a precious wheel because it enables the Bodhisattva to control all his or her delusions. The branch of enlightenment of correct wisdom is like a precious elephant because it enables him to ride to war against his delusions. The branch of enlightenment of correct effort is like a precious horse because it enables him to advance to the stage of Buddhahood very swiftly. The branch of enlightenment of correct joy is like a precious jewel because it always fills his or her mind with happiness. The branch of enlightenment of correct suppleness is like a precious queen because it removes all mental and physical discomfort and bestows great bliss. The branch of enlightenment of correct concentration is like a precious minister because it fulfils all the Bodhisattva’s wishes. The branch of enlightenment of correct equanimity is like a precious householder because it helps the Bodhisattva to abandon objects of abandonment and practise objects of attainment. The Bodhisattva trains in these practices principally on the path of seeing.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">A <a id="calibre_link-1030"></a>branch of superior paths is a superior path that causes the attainment of higher superior paths. There are eight types &ndash; the branches of superior paths of correct view, correct conception, correct speech, correct ends of actions, correct livelihood, correct effort, correct mindfulness and correct concentration. The branch of superior paths of correct view is a superior path that analyzes during the meditation break the emptiness seen during meditative equipoise. The branch of superior paths of correct conception is a superior path that is a motivation wishing to reveal to others the emptiness seen during meditative equipoise. The branch of superior paths of correct speech is a superior path that is the mental intention to maintain pure moral discipline of speech. The branch of superior paths of correct ends of actions is a superior path that is the mental intention to maintain pure moral discipline of body. The branch of superior paths of correct livelihood is a superior path that is the mental intention to maintain pure moral discipline of body and speech together. The branch of superior paths of correct effort is a superior path that strives to abandon unfavourable conditions and advance to higher levels. The branch of superior paths of correct mindfulness is a superior path that never forgets the meaning of the two truths. The branch of superior paths of correct concentration is a superior path that focuses on the meaning of the two truths single-pointedly. The Bodhisattva trains in these practices principally on the path of meditation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Both the seven <a id="calibre_link-1031"></a>branches of enlightenment and the eight branches of superior paths exist on the <a id="calibre_link-1032"></a>path of seeing and on the <a id="calibre_link-1033"></a>path of meditation but the former are taught principally as good qualities of a <a id="calibre_link-1034"></a>Bodhisattva on the path of seeing and the latter as good qualities of a Bodhisattva on the path of meditation. The main purpose of teaching the seven branches of enlightenment is to show that realizations that have abandoned obstructions and attained a deep knowledge of emptiness exist from the path of seeing onwards and the main purpose of teaching the eight branches of superior paths is to show that Bodhisattvas need continually to improve their realizations until they become Buddhas. It is a special quality of Bodhisattvas that no matter how exalted their realizations are they never become complacent.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The main path by which we pass from the stage of a <a id="calibre_link-1035"></a>sentient being to the stage of a Buddha is the path of meditation. If we are going to make a long journey we might first take a taxi to the station and then make most of the journey by train. Although taking the taxi was an essential part of the journey if someone asked us how we travelled we would say simply that we had come by train. In the analogy, the path of seeing is like taking the taxi and the path of meditation like taking the train. Although the attainment of the path of seeing marks the beginning of superior paths its duration is very short. As soon as our wisdom becomes powerful enough to abandon big-big innate delusions it transforms into the path of meditation. It is on the path of meditation that most of the work of eradicating delusions and their imprints and completing the training in the ten <a id="calibre_link-1036"></a>perfections is accomplished.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ABANDONMENT</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">[IV.2d] And what is related to the view of self is completely eradicated.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The Bodhisattva on the fourth ground has abandoned the small-big, innate view of the transitory collection. Related to this subtle view of the self are a gross <a id="calibre_link-1037"></a>self-grasping of persons that apprehends the self to be <a id="calibre_link-1038"></a>self-supporting and substantially existent as well as certain conceptions of <a id="calibre_link-1039"></a>true existence with respect to the aggregates, sources and elements. These are completely eradicated on the fourth ground.</p>

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	Definition of the fifth ground</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">3	Divisions of the fifth ground</p>
			<p class="text-heading">HOW THE FIFTH GROUND IS ATTAINED</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-1042"></a>fourth ground continues to meditate on emptiness until he or she attains the uninterrupted path that is the direct antidote to big-middling <a id="calibre_link-1043"></a>innate true-grasping. This is the <a id="calibre_link-1044"></a>uninterrupted path of the fourth ground. In the next moment he attains the <a id="calibre_link-1045"></a>released path that has completely abandoned big-middling innate true-grasping. This is the first moment of the fifth ground.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DEFINITION OF THE FIFTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of the <a id="calibre_link-1046"></a>fifth ground is a Superior Bodhisattva’s path that has abandoned big-middling innate true-grasping, its principal object of abandonment, and that has attained a surpassing practice of the perfection of mental stabilization from within the ten perfections.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS OF THE FIFTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-1047"></a>fifth ground has three divisions &ndash; the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the fifth ground, the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment of the fifth ground and the exalted awareness of the fifth ground that is neither of the two. The first has three divisions &ndash; the released path of the fifth ground, the uninterrupted path of the fifth ground and the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the fifth ground that is neither of the two. The first of these occurs at the very beginning of the fifth ground and the second, which is the direct antidote to middling-middling innate true-grasping, occurs at the very end. Between these two, the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise that is neither of the two and the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment arise alternately.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">EXPLANATION OF THE FIFTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The fifth ground will now be explained under the following two headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The etymology of the fifth ground</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	The surpassing mental stabilization and skill in the truths</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE FIFTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[V.1ab] This great being on the ground Difficult to Overcome</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Cannot be defeated even by all the maras.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-1048"></a>fifth ground cannot be overcome even by all the <a id="calibre_link-1049"></a>Devaputra <a id="calibre_link-1050"></a>maras throughout the universe, therefore this ground is called ‘Difficult to Overcome’. A mara, or <a id="calibre_link-1051"></a>demon, is anything that obstructs the attainment of liberation or enlightenment. There are four types &ndash; the mara of the <a id="calibre_link-1052"></a>delusions, the mara of the aggregates, the mara of the <a id="calibre_link-1053"></a>Lord of Death and the Devaputra maras. Of these, only the last are actual living beings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Our deluded minds such as attachment, anger and confusion are maras because they function only to obstruct our attainment of liberation. Without abandoning the delusions there is no way to attain liberation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The mara of the aggregates is our appropriated, contaminated <a id="calibre_link-1054"></a>aggregates. Generally, an aggregate is an assembly of parts produced by causes and conditions. Aggregate, product and <a id="calibre_link-1055"></a>functioning thing are synonyms. A contaminated aggregate is an aggregate that is produced from contaminated causes &ndash; delusions and actions motivated by delusions &ndash; and that functions to stimulate further delusions. All the places, bodies, minds and enjoyments of samsaric beings are contaminated aggregates. Contaminated aggregates and <a id="calibre_link-1056"></a>true sufferings are synonymous. There are two types of contaminated aggregate &ndash; internal contaminated aggregates and external contaminated aggregates. The former are contaminated aggregates that are a basis for imputing a person, and the latter are contaminated aggregates that are not a basis for imputing a person. Internal contaminated aggregates and appropriated aggregates are synonyms. Our present five aggregates of form, feeling, discrimination, compositional factors and consciousness are appropriated aggregates.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">All our <a id="calibre_link-1057"></a>miseries come from these appropriated, contaminated aggregates. Without them there would be no basis for suffering. Each time we take <a id="calibre_link-1058"></a>rebirth in samsara we appropriate contaminated aggregates. Having done so, without any choice we have to <a id="calibre_link-1059"></a>die, pass through the <a id="calibre_link-1060"></a>intermediate state, take another rebirth and so on. This endless cycle of misery, which is known as ‘<a id="calibre_link-1061"></a>samsara’, is nothing other than the appropriated, contaminated aggregates. Since we cannot attain liberation without abandoning these contaminated aggregates they are called ‘maras’. However, not all aggregates that are a basis for imputing a person are contaminated aggregates. A Buddha’s <a id="calibre_link-1062"></a>aggregates, for example, arise from the collections of merit and wisdom, not from karma and delusion. Only internal contaminated aggregates are maras.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">As for the third type of mara, the <a id="calibre_link-1063"></a>Lord of Death, or Yama, is not an actual living being but simply uncontrolled death. It is called a ‘lord’ because right now it has complete dominion over our lives. <a id="calibre_link-1064"></a>Je Tsongkhapa said there are two main obstacles to the attainment of liberation &ndash; death and ignorance. If we lose money, possessions, or friends we may suffer a temporary setback but our spiritual practice will not end. However if we lose our precious human life we lose our opportunity to practise Dharma and thereby our opportunity to attain liberation. For this reason uncontrolled death is called a ‘mara’.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The fourth type of mara, <a id="calibre_link-1065"></a>Devaputra, is wrathful <a id="calibre_link-1066"></a>Ishvara, a worldly deity inhabiting <a id="calibre_link-1067"></a>Land of Controlling Emanations, which is the highest level of the <a id="calibre_link-1068"></a>desire realm. He and his manifestations try to prevent Dharma practitioners from attaining <a id="calibre_link-1069"></a>liberation from samsara by disturbing their mental peace. If a Dharma practitioner suddenly loses interest in his or her practice, or if someone keeping pure moral discipline develops strong attachment for another person and breaks his or her vows, or when someone who previously had much faith begins to doubt and develop wrong views, these are often the work of Devaputra maras. When <a id="calibre_link-1070"></a>Buddha was about to attain enlightenment he was attacked by a hundred thousand million maras, all of whom were manifestations of Devaputra. They tried to disrupt his concentration in many ways such as attacking him with weapons and manifesting alluring women to distract him but because his concentration on love was so powerful they were utterly unable to disturb him.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE SURPASSING <a id="calibre_link-1071"></a>MENTAL STABILIZATION AND SKILL IN THE TRUTHS</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[V.1cd] His mental stabilization is surpassing and he also attains great skill in realizing</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">The subtle nature of the truths of a good mind.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Because the Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-1072"></a>fifth ground has abandoned all conditions discordant with perfect concentration such as gross and subtle distraction his or her practice of the perfection of mental stabilization is surpassing. The definition of perfection of mental stabilization is any concentration maintained by bodhichitta. It has two divisions &ndash; the transcending perfection of mental stabilization and the transcendent perfection of mental stabilization.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Bodhisattva on the fifth ground also attains great skill in realizing the gross and subtle nature of the <a id="calibre_link-1073"></a>four noble truths. Chandrakirti calls these ‘truths of a good mind’ because they are truths for Superior beings, or noble ones. The four noble truths are &ndash; <a id="calibre_link-1074"></a>true sufferings, <a id="calibre_link-1075"></a>true origins, true cessations and true paths.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-1076"></a>true suffering is a contaminated <a id="calibre_link-1077"></a>aggregate that is principally caused by deluded action. They are called ‘true sufferings’ because <a id="calibre_link-1078"></a>Superior beings, who see things as they really are, directly see them to have the nature of suffering. There are four types of <a id="calibre_link-1079"></a>true suffering &ndash; contaminated bodies, contaminated minds, contaminated environments and contaminated enjoyments. The first two are internal true sufferings because they are in the continuum of a person and the second two are external true sufferings because they are not in the continuum of a person.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-1080"></a>true origin is a delusion or action that is the main cause of true sufferings. They are called ‘true origins’ because they are the real source of all suffering and fear. There are two types of <a id="calibre_link-1081"></a>true origin &ndash; delusion true origins and action true origins. Delusion true origins are the first, eighth and ninth of the <a id="calibre_link-1082"></a>twelve dependent-related links, and action true origins are the second and tenth dependent-related links.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-1083"></a>true cessation is the ultimate nature of a mind that has abandoned any obstruction through the force of true paths. True cessations are like the effects of true paths, but they are not actual effects because they are permanent. There are two types of <a id="calibre_link-1084"></a>true cessation &ndash; Hinayana true cessations and Mahayana true cessations. There are two types of Hinayana true cessation &ndash; Hinayana true cessations of intellectually-formed delusions and Hinayana true cessations of innate delusions. There are three types of Mahayana true cessation &ndash; Mahayana true cessations of intellectually-formed delusions, Mahayana true cessations of innate delusions and Mahayana true cessations of obstructions to omniscience.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-1085"></a>true path is a Superior being’s realization held by the wisdom directly realizing emptiness. There are two types of <a id="calibre_link-1086"></a>true path &ndash; Hinayana true paths and Mahayana true paths. Each of these has three types &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-1087"></a>path of seeing, the <a id="calibre_link-1088"></a>path of meditation and the Path of No More Learning. The ultimate true path is the <a id="calibre_link-1089"></a>Mahayana Path of No More Learning, which is actual Buddhahood.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Buddha also taught sixteen aspects of the four noble truths. His purpose was twofold &ndash; to explain clearly the existence of liberation and how to attain it, and to eliminate sixteen misconceptions that are the main obstacles to liberation. Each of the four truths has four aspects. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The four aspects of <a id="calibre_link-1090"></a>true sufferings are &ndash; impermanence, suffering, emptiness and <a id="calibre_link-1091"></a><a id="calibre_link-1092"></a>selflessness. By contemplating the first aspect we overcome our attachment to samsaric places, bodies and enjoyments, and by contemplating the second we realize that because the very nature of samsaric objects is suffering they are all objects to be abandoned. By contemplating the third we realize gross selflessness, and by contemplating the fourth we realize subtle selflessness. In <a id="calibre_link-1093"></a><span class="italic">Commentary to Valid Cognition </span>Dharmakirti says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">Seeing selflessness liberates us from samsara. All the other aspects are taught for the sake of this.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">This means that Buddha taught the first three aspects of true sufferings as a foundation for meditating on and realizing the fourth aspect. It is the realization of subtle selflessness that liberates us from samsara.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The four aspects of <a id="calibre_link-1094"></a>true origins are &ndash; cause, origin, strong production and condition. By contemplating the first we gain a deep conviction that all <a id="calibre_link-1095"></a>suffering has a cause, and by contemplating the second we realize that <a id="calibre_link-1096"></a>delusions and deluded actions are the origin of all suffering. By contemplating the third we realize that true origins are capable of producing strong suffering such as the suffering of the <a id="calibre_link-1097"></a>hells, and by contemplating the fourth we realize that it is true origins that create the conditions for all adversity such as sickness, poverty, famine and war. Contemplating these four aspects strengthens our determination to abandon true origins.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The four aspects of <a id="calibre_link-1098"></a>true cessations are &ndash; cessation, peace, supreme attainment and definite abandonment. By contemplating the first we realize that <a id="calibre_link-1099"></a>liberation is a true cessation of all true origins and therefore of all true sufferings, and by contemplating the second we realize that liberation is real peace because it is the abandonment of all delusions. By contemplating the third we realize that liberation is a supreme attainment because it is completely non-deceptive, and by contemplating the fourth we realize that it is a definite abandonment because it is an irreversible release from samsaric faults. Contemplating these four aspects encourages us to strive to attain true cessations.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The four aspects of <a id="calibre_link-1100"></a>true paths are &ndash; path, antidote, accomplishment and definite abandoner. The principal true path is the <a id="calibre_link-1101"></a>wisdom directly realizing emptiness. By contemplating the first aspect we realize that this wisdom is a path because it leads us to the destination of liberation, and by contemplating the second we realize that it is the antidote because it directly eliminates delusions. By contemplating the third we realize that it is an accomplishment because it leads to perfect attainments, and by contemplating the fourth we realize that it is a definite abandoner because it is the principal method for abandoning all suffering and all faults. Contemplating these four aspects encourages us to meditate on true paths.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The sixteen misconceptions eliminated by contemplating the sixteen aspects of the <a id="calibre_link-1102"></a>four noble truths are:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	Contaminated <a id="calibre_link-1103"></a>aggregates are permanent</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">The first four are misconceptions with respect to true sufferings, the next four are misconceptions with respect to true origins, the next four are misconceptions with respect to true cessations and the last four are misconceptions with respect to true paths. All these misconceptions can be overcome by meditating sincerely on the sixteen aspects of the four noble truths. For example, the first three can be overcome by meditating on impermanence and suffering, the fourth by meditating on emptiness and selflessness, the next four by meditating on the four aspects of true origins and so on.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The root text says that the Bodhisattva on the fifth ground has great skill in realizing the ‘subtle nature’ of the four truths. According to the Madhyamika-Prasangika school there are two types of <a id="calibre_link-1104"></a><a id="calibre_link-1105"></a>four noble truths &ndash; gross four noble truths and subtle four noble truths. This is because there are two types of self-grasping of persons &ndash; gross <a id="calibre_link-1106"></a>self-grasping of persons (grasping at a <a id="calibre_link-1107"></a>self-supporting, substantially existent person) and subtle <a id="calibre_link-1108"></a>self-grasping of persons (grasping at an inherently existent person). The difference between these two types of self-grasping is explained in the ninth chapter of the book <a id="calibre_link-1109"></a><span class="italic">Meaningful to Behold</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Because there are two types of self-grasping there are two types of delusion that arise from them &ndash; gross <a id="calibre_link-1110"></a>delusions and subtle <a id="calibre_link-1111"></a>delusions &ndash; and because there are two types of delusion there are two types of karma created through the force of these delusions. Therefore there are two types of <a id="calibre_link-1112"></a>true origin &ndash; gross true origins and subtle true origins. <a id="calibre_link-1113"></a>Delusion and karma that arise in dependence on grasping at a self-supporting, substantially existent person are gross true origins and their results are gross true sufferings. Delusion and karma that arise in dependence on grasping at an inherently existent person are subtle true origins and their results are subtle true sufferings. A path that directly realizes the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person is a gross <a id="calibre_link-1114"></a>true path and the cessation that is an abandonment of the conception of a self-supporting, substantially existent person is a gross <a id="calibre_link-1115"></a>true cessation. A path that directly realizes the lack of an inherently existent person is a subtle true path and the cessation that is an abandonment of the conception of an inherently existent person is a subtle true cessation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">According to the Madhyamika-Prasangika school the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person is a gross <a id="calibre_link-1116"></a>selflessness and comparatively easy to realize. Even ordinary beings can attain a direct realization of this selflessness, but no matter how long we meditate on it we will not be able to abandon actual self-grasping. The best we will achieve will be a temporary abandonment of gross self-grasping and the delusions that depend on it. Therefore, the wisdom directly realizing the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person is not an actual true path and the cessation to which it leads is not an actual true cessation. However, the conception of a self-supporting, substantially existent person is a delusion true origin and the sufferings to which it gives rise are true sufferings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">To know the presentations of the gross and subtle four noble truths is to know the complete path to liberation. Therefore <a id="calibre_link-1117"></a>Dharmakirti says that if we want to attain liberation all we need is a Teacher who is skilled in the four noble truths.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> Sometimes Buddha says there are <a id="calibre_link-1118"></a>four truths and at other times he says there are two truths. How are the four truths related to the <a id="calibre_link-1119"></a>two truths?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para"><span class="italic">Answer</span> The two truths are ultimate truth and <a id="calibre_link-1120"></a>conventional truths. All emptinesses are ultimate truths and all phenomena other than emptiness are conventional truths. All objects of knowledge are included within these two truths. We may wonder, therefore, why Buddha also taught the four truths. His purpose was to show what is to be abandoned and what is to be practised by those seeking liberation. Thus, <a id="calibre_link-1121"></a>true sufferings and <a id="calibre_link-1122"></a>true origins are to be abandoned and <a id="calibre_link-1123"></a>true cessations and <a id="calibre_link-1124"></a>true paths are to be practised. The four noble truths, however, are not separate from the two truths but are included within them. True sufferings, true origins and true paths are conventional truths, and true cessations are ultimate truths. This is clearly established in the <a id="calibre_link-1125"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span> and in Nagarjuna’s <a id="calibre_link-1126"></a><span class="italic">Sixty Verses of Reasoning</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">It is very important to understand how true cessations are ultimate truths, or <a id="calibre_link-1127"></a>emptinesses. The reason is as follows. Because our mind is presently covered by obstructions the emptiness of our mind is also covered by obstructions. When through meditation on true paths our mind is freed from any obstruction, simultaneously the emptiness of our mind is also freed from that obstruction. A freedom of the emptiness of the mind from any obstruction through meditation on true paths is a true cessation. Because such cessations are not different from the emptiness of the mind true cessations are emptinesses and therefore ultimate truths.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-1128"></a>True paths and <a id="calibre_link-1129"></a>true cessations are <a id="calibre_link-1130"></a>Dharma Jewels. Right now it is not easy for us to attain realizations of actual true paths and true cessations, but if we practise sincerely and continuously, eventually these realizations will come. If we have even the slightest experience of Dharma we should regard it as the seedling from which these realizations will eventually grow and nourish it accordingly. Our present experiences of Dharma, therefore, are precious and should not be disregarded or neglected. If we care for a young seedling in the appropriate way it will eventually grow into a large tree and bear fruit. In the same way, if we carefully nourish our present experiences of Dharma they will eventually grow into realizations of true paths and true cessations and bear the fruit of liberation. We should never forget that we already have the seeds of actual Dharma Jewels within us.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The attainments of actual true paths and actual true cessations come from an understanding of the emptiness, or the <a id="calibre_link-1131"></a>lack of inherent existence, revealed by the Madhyamika-Prasangika school. This is the main subject of the present work and it will now be explained extensively in the following chapters.</p>

			<p class="text-heading">THE SIXTH GROUND, APPROACHING</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This has two parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Introduction to the <a id="calibre_link-1136"></a>sixth ground</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Explanation of the sixth ground</p>
			<p class="text-heading">INTRODUCTION TO THE SIXTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">As mentioned before, <a id="calibre_link-1137"></a><span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span> is principally a commentary to the presentation of emptiness given by Nagarjuna in <a id="calibre_link-1138"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span>. Chandrakirti sets this commentary in the context of his explanation of the sixth ground because it is on this ground that the practice of the <a id="calibre_link-1139"></a>perfection of wisdom becomes surpassing.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Since Chandrakirti’s main purpose is to establish the supremacy of the <a id="calibre_link-1140"></a>Madhyamika-Prasangika view he presents the commentary as a series of debates between the Madhyamika-Prasangikas and proponents of other tenets, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist. It is important to study these <a id="calibre_link-1141"></a>debates in detail and not to pass over them superficially or to dismiss them as having no practical application. Penetrating the meaning established by these debates is an indispensable method for developing wisdom realizing emptiness. If we spend a long time on each debate, thinking about its significance and its application with strong concentration we will gradually clear away the wrong views that obstruct the path to inner peace and develop a lucid wisdom cognizing the ultimate nature of reality. It is especially important to dwell at length on the interchange between the <a id="calibre_link-1142"></a>Chittamatrins and the Madhyamika-Prasangikas and to try to understand how these two apparently opposing views can be united. Many great Yogis, including Je Tsongkhapa, Gyalwa Ensapa and Khedrub Sangye Yeshe, have praised as pre-eminent the union of these two views.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Although the debates appear to be disputes between formal schools of thought we should understand that they are presented in this way only to help us to clarify our thoughts. The various participants often perform the function of anticipating doubts or misunderstandings that may arise in our own minds. If we contemplate deeply the replies given by the <a id="calibre_link-1143"></a>Madhyamika-Prasangikas we will gradually dispel such doubts and misunderstandings. As Chandrakirti himself says, these debates are not presented merely for the sake of argument or to discredit others; their purpose is only to reveal emptiness to help us attain liberation from samsara.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The sixth ground will now be introduced under the following three headings:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">1	How the sixth ground is attained</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">2	Definition of the sixth ground</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last-full-space-below">3	Divisions of the sixth ground</p>
			<p class="text-heading">HOW THE SIXTH GROUND IS ATTAINED</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-1144"></a>fifth ground continues to meditate on emptiness until he or she attains the uninterrupted path that is the direct antidote to middling-middling <a id="calibre_link-1145"></a>innate true-grasping. This is the <a id="calibre_link-1146"></a>uninterrupted path of the fifth ground. In the next moment he attains the <a id="calibre_link-1147"></a>released path that has completely abandoned middling-middling innate true-grasping. This is the first moment of the sixth ground.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DEFINITION OF THE SIXTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of the <a id="calibre_link-1148"></a>sixth ground is a Superior Bodhisattva’s path that has abandoned middling-middling innate true-grasping, its principal object of abandonment and that has attained a surpassing practice of the perfection of wisdom from within the ten perfections.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS OF THE SIXTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-1149"></a>sixth ground has three divisions &ndash; the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the sixth ground, the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment of the sixth ground and the exalted awareness of the sixth ground that is neither of the two. The first has three divisions &ndash; the released path of the sixth ground, the uninterrupted path of the sixth ground and the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the sixth ground that is neither of the two. The first of these occurs at the very beginning of the sixth ground and the second, which is the direct antidote to small-middling innate true-grasping, occurs at the very end. Between these two, the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise that is neither of the two and the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment arise alternately.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">EXPLANATION OF THE SIXTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The sixth ground will now be explained extensively under the following four headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	The etymology of this ground and the surpassing perfection of wisdom</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	A praise of the perfection of wisdom</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">3	An explanation of the profound thatness of dependent arising</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">4	Conclusion by way of expressing the good qualities of the ground</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE ETYMOLOGY OF THIS GROUND AND THE SURPASSING PERFECTION OF WISDOM</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.1] Abiding in a mind of meditative equipoise on Approaching</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">He approaches the state of complete Buddhahood.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">He sees the thatness of dependent arising</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">And through abiding in wisdom attains cessation.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Through the force of the powerful concentration attained on the fifth ground the Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-1150"></a>sixth ground is always happy to meditate on emptiness and his or her mind abides in a very special meditative equipoise. Through the great skill in the <a id="calibre_link-1151"></a>four truths he attained on the fifth ground he attains a surpassing practice of the <a id="calibre_link-1152"></a><a id="calibre_link-1153"></a>perfection of wisdom. He can now see profound emptiness extremely clearly. With this special concentration and wisdom he quickly approaches the state of complete Buddhahood. For this reason the sixth ground is called ‘Approaching’. In the scriptures emptiness is often called ‘<a id="calibre_link-1154"></a>thatness’ because it is the ultimate nature of phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Because the Bodhisattva on the sixth ground possesses a special <a id="calibre_link-1155"></a>wisdom he attains an extraordinary <a id="calibre_link-1156"></a>absorption of cessation. The definition of absorption of cessation is an uncontaminated wisdom focused single-pointedly on emptiness in dependence on the actual absorption of <a id="calibre_link-1157"></a>peak of samsara. Some Hinayana <a id="calibre_link-1158"></a>Superiors attain an uncontaminated mind focused single-pointedly on emptiness before completing all eight actual absorptions but that is not an absorption of cessation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">It is important to distinguish the absorption of cessation from the <a id="calibre_link-1159"></a>concentration of perfect liberation of cessation and the <a id="calibre_link-1160"></a>absorption without discrimination. All three are similar in that they are concentrations attained through stopping gross feelings and gross discriminations, but they are quite different from the point of view of their bases. The absorption of cessation can be attained only by Superior beings, the concentration of perfect liberation of cessation can be attained by ordinary beings who have entered the path to liberation and the absorption without discrimination can be attained by anyone who has accomplished the actual absorption of the fourth mental stabilization of the form realm, even if they have not entered the path to liberation. Bodhisattvas on the great stage of the <a id="calibre_link-1161"></a>path of accumulation have attained all the <a id="calibre_link-1162"></a>form and <a id="calibre_link-1163"></a>formless realm absorptions and also the concentration of perfect liberation of cessation but they have not attained the absorption of cessation. Because both the concentration of perfect liberation of cessation and the absorption of cessation are motivated by renunciation or bodhichitta they are causes of liberation or enlightenment. The absorption without discrimination, however, is motivated by ignorance and is a cause of samsaric rebirth.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The absorption without discrimination is a concentration of the fourth form realm that observes nothingness and that is attained by stopping gross feelings and gross discriminations. As mentioned before, there are eight levels of the fourth <a id="calibre_link-1164"></a>form realm, three inhabited by ordinary beings and five by Hinayana Superiors. In the highest of the three levels of ordinary beings, Great Result, there is a land called ‘Land Without Discrimination’. The <a id="calibre_link-1165"></a>gods who inhabit this land are called ‘<a id="calibre_link-1166"></a>long-life gods’. In their entire life they have only two gross minds <span class="normal">&ndash;</span> one at the very beginning and one just before they die. For the rest of the time they are absorbed in nothingness with no mental activity whatsoever. They remain in this state for many aeons &ndash; for as long as their karma for this rebirth is not exhausted &ndash; but when they emerge from it the moment before they die they feel as if they had entered the absorption only a moment before. The lower Buddhist Vaibhashika school believe that between birth and death these gods have no mind. According to the higher schools, however, this is impossible. What happens is that their gross minds cease by dissolving into their subtle mind. The main cause of rebirth as a long-life god is the absorption without discrimination.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Sometimes to pacify a disturbed mind it may be beneficial to practise a facsimile of absorption without discrimination by letting our mind go blank without any manifest thoughts or feelings. This is the meditation taught by the Chinese monk <a id="calibre_link-1167"></a>Hashang. As we will see later, he wrongly claimed that this was the meditation on emptiness taught by Buddha. Since it is very relaxing to disengage the mind in this way many people are fooled into believing that this meditation is a path to liberation, but in reality it is a cause of rebirth in samsara. If we practise the absorption without discrimination on the basis of the actual absorption of the fourth mental stabilization of the form realm it leads to rebirth as a long-life god, and if we practise it with a desire realm mind it leads to rebirth as a spirit.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Although the <a id="calibre_link-1168"></a>absorption of cessation is also a concentration attained through the cessation of gross feelings and gross discriminations its actual object is ultimate truth,  emptiness. Here, ‘cessation’ refers to a cessation of dualistic appearance and ‘absorption’ to a state in which, through the force of concentration, all the elements in the body are perfectly balanced, comfortable and healthy.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">To enter the absorption of cessation the Yogi or Yogini must prevent gross minds by withdrawing gross feelings and gross discriminations. For a Superior being with a desire realm body, this means preventing the five sense consciousnesses and the gross mental consciousness. For a form realm being, it means preventing the eye consciousness, ear consciousness, body consciousness and gross mental consciousness. Because <a id="calibre_link-1169"></a>form realm beings have bodies made of light and do not eat food, they have no need of a tongue sense power or a nose sense power. For <a id="calibre_link-1170"></a><a id="calibre_link-1171"></a>formless realm beings to enter the absorption of cessation they need to prevent only the gross mental consciousness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Initially, the absorption of cessation can be entered only from the actual absorption of <a id="calibre_link-1172"></a>peak of samsara but with training <a id="calibre_link-1173"></a>Superior Bodhisattvas develop the ability to enter it instantaneously from any level of mind. To train in this absorption in one session they begin by meditating on the actual absorption of the first mental stabilization of the <a id="calibre_link-1174"></a>form realm, then enter the absorption of cessation, then the actual absorption of the second mental stabilization, then the absorption of cessation and so on up to the actual absorption of peak of samsara. From there they enter the absorption of cessation once again and emerge with a <a id="calibre_link-1175"></a>desire realm mind. Thus, from the subtlest level of mind, the absorption of cessation, they immediately manifest the grossest level, the mind of the desire realm. This indicates that they have very powerful concentration. With the desire realm mind they relax for a while and then they begin the sequence over again, moving between the eight actual absorptions and the absorption of cessation and finally relaxing again with the desire realm mind. For the Superior Bodhisattva engaged in this training the eight actual absorptions and the absorption of cessation are all wisdoms of meditative equipoise mixed non-dualistically with <a id="calibre_link-1176"></a>emptiness. <a id="calibre_link-1177"></a>Buddha called this training the ‘<a id="calibre_link-1178"></a>concentration of a lion circling’. It is one of the principal practices of a Superior Bodhisattva. Through this practice, he or she completes the training in meditative stabilization and eventually attains the ability of a Buddha to engage in <a id="calibre_link-1179"></a>meditative equipoise on emptiness and the activities of <a id="calibre_link-1180"></a>subsequent attainment simultaneously. Only Buddhas can remain single-pointedly absorbed in emptiness while giving teachings and guiding living beings along the spiritual path.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> Bodhisattvas on the first five grounds also attain the absorption of cessation, so why is it given as a good quality of the sixth ground?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> The reason is that the Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-1181"></a>sixth ground attains an extraordinary absorption of cessation as a result of completing the three trainings in higher wisdom &ndash; great skill in knowledge of the <a id="calibre_link-1182"></a>four noble truths, great skill in knowledge of the serial and reverse orders of the <a id="calibre_link-1183"></a>twelve dependent-related links and great skill in knowledge of emptiness. Thus it is said that the Bodhisattva on the sixth ground attains a surpassing practice of the <a id="calibre_link-1184"></a>perfection of wisdom.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of perfection of wisdom is a wisdom maintained by bodhichitta that realizes the ultimate nature of phenomena. It has two divisions &ndash; the transcending perfection of wisdom and the transcendent perfection of wisdom.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">A PRAISE OF THE PERFECTION OF WISDOM</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.2] Just as one person with sight can easily lead</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">A whole group of blind people to where they want to go,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Similarly, here, wisdom takes those qualities that lack sight</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">And goes to the state of a Conqueror.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Chandrakirti praises the <a id="calibre_link-1185"></a>perfection of wisdom by showing how it leads all the other <a id="calibre_link-1186"></a>perfections to the resultant grounds of Buddhahood. Just as one person with sight can easily lead an entire group of blind people to where they want to go, so the perfection of wisdom takes all the other perfections such as giving that lack the view of emptiness to the final destination of Buddhahood.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Because our mind is covered by the two <a id="calibre_link-1187"></a>obstructions, which prevent us from attaining enlightenment, we are like a blind person. The perfection of wisdom is like a guide. It alone has the power to lead us to the city of enlightenment by removing the two <a id="calibre_link-1188"></a>obstructions. Even if we accomplish all the other perfections, such as giving, moral discipline and patience we will never attain enlightenment without the perfection of wisdom.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">In <a id="calibre_link-1189"></a><span class="italic">The Three Principal Aspects of the Path</span> Je Tsongkhapa says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">But, even though you may be acquainted with renunciation and bodhichitta,</p>

			<p class="text-2nd-para">It is customary for an author to compose a <a id="calibre_link-1195"></a>promise to explain in which he indicates what the subject matter of the book will be and what his reasons are for composing it. This promise is usually placed at the beginning of the book, but in this case Chandrakirti includes it at the beginning of the sixth chapter. He does so to indicate that his principal intention in composing the <span class="italic">Guide</span> is to reveal the profound meaning of emptiness. He says that he will explain the very profound Dharma of emptiness according to the works of Superior Nagarjuna, where it is presented in dependence on numerous scriptural citations and extensive logical reasoning in just the same way as it is realized by the Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-1196"></a>sixth ground.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Since the <span class="italic">Guide</span> explains Buddha’s final view of emptiness in accordance with the works of Nagarjuna it is important to develop faith in Nagarjuna and be convinced of the authenticity of his works. All the great Masters of the Madhyamika-Prasangika and Madhyamika-Svatantrika schools revere Nagarjuna as a valid author and meditation Master. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below"><a id="calibre_link-1197"></a>Nagarjuna’s life and works were prophesied several times by Buddha. In a well-known passage in <a id="calibre_link-1198"></a><span class="italic">Gone to Lanka Sutra</span> Buddha is asked who will uphold the doctrine after he has passed away. Buddha replies:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">In the Southern region, in the Land of the Palms,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">The monk Shriman of great renown,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Known by the name, ‘Naga’,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Will refute the extremes of existence and non-existence.</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Having proclaimed to the world my teachings,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">The unsurpassed Great <a id="calibre_link-1199"></a>Vehicle,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">He will accomplish the ground Very Joyful,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">And depart to the Land of Bliss.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">As predicted, four hundred years after Buddha passed away, a son was born to a prosperous Brahmin family living in an area of Southern India known as Bedarwa, or the ‘Land of the Palms’. An oracle predicted that the child would live for only seven days, but that his lifespan could be extended by a further seven days if gifts were bestowed on a hundred ordinary people, by a further seven months if offerings were made to a hundred brahmins, or by a further seven years if offerings were made to a hundred monks. However, the oracle knew of no method to extend his life beyond that. Accordingly, his parents made offerings to a hundred monks, and as a result were able to live happily with their son for seven years. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">As the child’s seventh birthday drew near, however, they sent him on a pilgrimage with several of their servants, for they could not bear to witness his death. Guided by a manifestation of <a id="calibre_link-1200"></a>Avalokiteshvara, the party made its way to <a id="calibre_link-1201"></a>Nalanda Monastery where they met the great Teacher <a id="calibre_link-1202"></a>Saraha. They explained the boy’s plight to Saraha and he told them that the child could avert an untimely death by staying at Nalanda and taking ordination as a monk. He gave the child an empowerment into the long-life practice of Buddha <a id="calibre_link-1203"></a>Amitayus and encouraged him to practise that yoga extensively. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">On the eve of his seventh birthday the child recited the <a id="calibre_link-1204"></a>mantra of Amitayus without interruption and as a result averted an untimely death. The following day he ordained as a monk and was given the name ‘<a id="calibre_link-1205"></a>Shrimanta’. He remained at Nalanda where under the protection of <a id="calibre_link-1206"></a>Manjushri he was able to study all the Sutras and <a id="calibre_link-1207"></a>Tantras. He soon became a fully-accomplished scholar and Teacher and his reputation spread widely. Eventually he was appointed Abbot of Nalanda.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Nagarjuna’s life comprised three great periods of auspicious deeds that correspond to Buddha’s three turnings of the Wheel of Dharma, which is why he is often referred to as ‘the Second Buddha’. The first period was during his tenure as Abbot of Nalanda. Unfortunately, the moral discipline of the monks had degenerated since the time Buddha first gave the vows and <a id="calibre_link-1208"></a>Nagarjuna was very active in restoring the purity of the discipline. He clarified many points of moral discipline in extensive teachings and composed a number of works on pure conduct. These writings, known as the <a id="calibre_link-1209"></a><span class="italic">Collection of Advice</span>, include such works as <a id="calibre_link-1210"></a><span class="italic">Precious Garland</span>, <span class="italic">Friendly Letter</span>, <span class="italic">Tree of Wisdom</span>, <span class="italic">A Hundred Wisdoms</span> and <span class="italic">Drops for Healing Beings</span>. These activities are likened to Buddha’s first turning of the Wheel of Dharma.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Nagarjuna is best remembered, however, for the works of the second period. Not long after Buddha passed away, the <a id="calibre_link-1211"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span>, the principal <a id="calibre_link-1212"></a>Mahayana teachings, disappeared from this world. It is said that this is because some <a id="calibre_link-1213"></a>nagas who had received this teaching from Buddha had taken the <span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom</span> scriptures to their own world for safekeeping. There remained only a few practitioners who could understand these teachings and most of them kept their practice secret. The only teachings of Buddha to remain widespread were the <a id="calibre_link-1214"></a>Hinayana teachings and as a result many people assumed that these were the only teachings Buddha had given. Some time later the nagas invited Nagarjuna to visit them, and returned the <span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom</span> scriptures to him. Nagarjuna brought the scriptures to the human world and propagated them widely. Because of his special relationship with the nagas and because he cured many nagas of sickness by means of special ritual prayers, Nagarjuna was given the name ‘Protector of the nagas’. ‘Arjuna’ was added to his name because he spread the Mahayana teachings with great speed and accuracy just as the legendary archer Arjuna had delivered arrows from his bow. Hence he finally became known as ‘Protector Nagarjuna’.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Because he had a very lucid mind and great wisdom, Nagarjuna was able perfectly to understand the <span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span> and explain them to others. He spread these teachings widely, thus instigating a great revival of the Mahayana doctrine in this world. He presented a system of reasoning which, because it steers a flawless course between the two extremes of existence and non-existence, became known as the ‘Philosophy of the <a id="calibre_link-1215"></a>Middle Way’, or ‘<a id="calibre_link-1216"></a>Madhyamaka’. <a id="calibre_link-1217"></a>Nagarjuna composed many commentaries to the <span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span> that elucidate the Madhyamaka view. These treatises, known as the <a id="calibre_link-1218"></a><span class="italic">Collection of Reasonings</span>, include the famous <a id="calibre_link-1219"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way</span> and its four limbs &ndash; <span class="italic">Sixty Reasonings</span>, <span class="italic">Seventy Emptinesses</span>, <span class="italic">Finely Woven</span> and <span class="italic">Refutation of Objections</span>. He also wrote <span class="italic">Compendium of Sutras</span>, <span class="italic">Five Stages of the Completion Stage of Guhyasamaja</span> and many other commentaries to the Sutras and <a id="calibre_link-1220"></a>Tantras. These activities are likened to Buddha’s second turning of the Wheel of Dharma.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Nagarjuna’s third period of auspicious deeds took place towards the end of his life. Acting on advice from <a id="calibre_link-1221"></a>Tara, he returned to Southern India and dwelt at a place called Mount Splendour where he gave further extensive teachings on both the Sutras and Tantras and composed many more texts. These writings, known as the <a id="calibre_link-1222"></a><span class="italic">Collection of Praises</span>, include such works as <span class="italic">Praise of the Dharmadhatu</span>, <span class="italic">Praise of the Supramundane</span>, <span class="italic">Praise of the Inconceivable</span> and <span class="italic">Praise of the Ultimate</span>. These activities are likened to Buddha’s third turning of the Wheel of Dharma.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">It is not possible in such a brief account even to begin to do justice to Nagarjuna’s life and works. Throughout his life he devoted himself entirely to reviving the Mahayana Dharma and to sustaining the Mahayana <a id="calibre_link-1223"></a>Sangha. To this end he gave prolific teachings, composed many books and performed countless other excellent deeds. As mentioned in <a id="calibre_link-1224"></a><span class="italic">Gone to Lanka Sutra</span>, Nagarjuna had accomplished the realization of the Bodhisattva’s first ground, called ‘Very Joyful’. He then advanced further and finally reached the land of the supreme bliss of enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">RECOGNIZING A SUITABLE RECIPIENT FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE PROFOUND MEANING</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">If those who are unsuitable recipients listen to teachings on <a id="calibre_link-1225"></a>emptiness there is a danger they might misunderstand and fall into the extreme of non-existence. Indeed, Nagarjuna himself says that if emptiness is taught to those with little wisdom and they find fault with the teaching they will experience suffering as a result. The following story illustrates the dangers of teaching emptiness to those who are not ready. In ancient times there was a great meditator called <a id="calibre_link-1226"></a>Elephant Skin, who was so called because he used to meditate in a tent made from the skin of a dead elephant. Through the force of his renunciation he meditated continuously on emptiness until he completely eradicated all his delusions and became a Foe Destroyer. His fame quickly spread and finally reached the king of that region. The king visited the Yogi and requested teachings so that he too might acquire such fame. Elephant Skin explained to the king how all phenomena are empty of true existence. The king, however, did not have the wisdom to understand this teaching and took Elephant Skin to be saying that phenomena do not exist at all. Outraged that such perverse views were being spread in his kingdom, the king ordered Elephant Skin to be put to death. Some years later the king met another Teacher who carefully explained to him all the stages of the path, from the preciousness of our human life through to the faults of samsara. He then gradually introduced the king to the subtle view that all phenomena lack true existence. This time the king understood and was struck with great remorse when he realized that his first Teacher had in fact given him authentic teachings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Chandrakirti describes the kind of person who is best suited to receive an explanation of <a id="calibre_link-1227"></a>emptiness. He says that even though the person may be a beginner, if on hearing teachings on emptiness they repeatedly develop a feeling of great joy, their eyes moisten with tears of great joy and the hairs of their body stand on end, these are internal and external signs that for that person the potentiality to realize emptiness is about to ripen. Such a person is an ideal vessel to receive teachings on profound thatness. In general, all <a id="calibre_link-1228"></a>living beings have the potential to realize emptiness because they all have the seed of Buddhahood but it is only when this seed becomes active and powerful that they become ideal recipients for teachings on emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-1229"></a>Je Tsongkhapa says that even though we might not yet be the ideal recipient that Chandrakirti describes here, if we nevertheless have a good motivation and great faith it is beneficial for us to listen to teachings on emptiness and it is appropriate for Teachers to give instructions. Listening to such teachings creates a great stock of <a id="calibre_link-1230"></a>merit and sows the seed for us to understand emptiness in the future. However, the Teacher must be very skilful in the way he or she explains emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">In <a id="calibre_link-1231"></a><span class="italic">Compendium of Sutras</span> Nagarjuna says that if we have a pleasing mind towards profound Dharma we will collect a great store of merit, gradually acquire all the mundane and supramundane qualities and eventually attain enlightenment. In <a id="calibre_link-1232"></a><span class="italic">Sutra Given by the Infant Rahadatta</span> Buddha says that if those who listen to the profound Dharma of emptiness with doubts receive a great amount of <a id="calibre_link-1233"></a>merit, what need is there to mention those who listen without doubts? Buddha also makes a similar point in <a id="calibre_link-1234"></a><span class="italic">Vajra Cutting Sutra</span>.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">When a suitable recipient receives teachings on emptiness he or she will develop an unmistaken view of emptiness and as a result develop many special qualities. He will treasure the view of emptiness as his most precious possession and will see that if he takes rebirth in the lower realms in his next life he will lose this precious view. To prevent this happening he will take vows and always maintain pure moral discipline. Seeing that even if he takes a human rebirth in his next life he will not be able to continue his practice if he is hindered by poverty or lack of basic resources, he will practise giving extensively. Seeing that his practice of emptiness will be a cause of Buddhahood only if it is conjoined with great compassion, he will always rely on meditation on <a id="calibre_link-1235"></a>compassion and <a id="calibre_link-1236"></a>bodhichitta. Seeing that anger destroys virtues and leads to rebirth in the lower realms and separation from holy beings, he will always practise patience. Seeing that to complete the path to Buddhahood he must train in all the <a id="calibre_link-1237"></a>perfections, he will also practise effort and concentration. Moreover, he will fully dedicate all his virtues to the attainment of full enlightenment so that he can liberate all living beings from samsara. Having found the correct view of emptiness he will always maintain great respect for the Teachers from whom he received these precious teachings as well as for all other objects of refuge.</p>

			<p class="text-heading">HOW THE CORRECT MEANING IS REVEALED IN THE SCRIPTURES</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The principal scriptures that reveal Buddha’s ultimate view, the correct meaning of emptiness, are the <a id="calibre_link-1243"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span>. These include the <span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom in a Hundred Thousand Lines</span>, the <span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom in Twenty-five Thousand Lines</span>, the <span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines</span>, the <span class="italic">Condensed Perfection of Wisdom Sutra</span> and the <span class="italic">Essence of Wisdom Sutra</span>, more commonly known as the <a id="calibre_link-1244"></a><a id="calibre_link-1245"></a><span class="italic">Heart Sutra</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">When Chandrakirti introduces the sixth chapter in his <a id="calibre_link-1246"></a><span class="italic">Autocommentary</span>, to show how the correct meaning of emptiness is revealed in the scriptures he quotes from <a id="calibre_link-1247"></a><span class="italic">Sutra on the Ten Grounds</span> where Buddha explains how a Bodhisattva advances from the fifth to the sixth ground by realizing the <a id="calibre_link-1248"></a><a id="calibre_link-1249"></a>ten equalities of phenomena:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	The equality of all conventional phenomena in lacking signs</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(2)	The equality of all phenomena in lacking characteristics</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(3)	The equality of all future things in lacking production</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(4)	The equality of all phenomena in non-production</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(5)	The equality of all phenomena in separation</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(6)	The equality of all phenomena in complete purity from the beginning</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(7)	The equality of all phenomena in lacking elaboration</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(8)	The equality of all phenomena in lacking acceptance and rejection</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(9)	The equality of all phenomena in resembling illusions, dreams, shadows, echoes, the moon in water, reflections and <a id="calibre_link-1250"></a>emanations</p>
			<p class="text-list-10-to-99-with-parenthesis-last">(10)	The equality of all phenomena in lacking being thing and non-thing</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Each of these ten equalities is mere emptiness, <a id="calibre_link-1251"></a>lack of <a id="calibre_link-1252"></a>inherent existence. If we understand these we understand the meaning that is the <a id="calibre_link-1253"></a>object of meditation of the Bodhisattva on the sixth ground. Their principal meaning can be understood as follows. Buddha’s ultimate view, the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena, is very subtle and profound, and among Buddha’s countless followers only the Madhyamika-Prasangikas understand it correctly. Proponents of other Buddhist tenets such as the <a id="calibre_link-1254"></a>Madhyamika-Svatantrikas and the <a id="calibre_link-1255"></a>Chittamatrins assert that all phenomena are inherently existent. Why do they assert this? They argue that we know that phenomena have distinct signs such as colour, shape and function, and distinct characteristics such as good, bad and neutral qualities. Moreover, we can know past, present and future things, we can know that some things are already produced whereas others are yet to be produced and we can know that some phenomena are things and others are non-things. How could all these different signs and characteristics exist if phenomena were not inherently existent, if they did not exist from their own side?</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The Madhyamika-Prasangikas reply that even though conventionally phenomena have their own uncommon signs by which they are identified, these signs and the phenomena that possess them are all equally empty of inherent existence because none of these conventional phenomena exists with respect to the <a id="calibre_link-1256"></a>exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of a Superior being. All that appears to the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of a Superior being is ultimate truth, emptiness. Thus, in <a id="calibre_link-1257"></a><a id="calibre_link-1258"></a><span class="italic">Heart Sutra</span> Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">Therefore, <a id="calibre_link-1259"></a>Shariputra, in emptiness there is no form, no feeling, no discrimination, no compositional factors, no consciousness. There is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no <a id="calibre_link-1260"></a>mentality; no form, no sound, no smell, no taste, no tactile object, no phenomenon. There is no eye element and so forth up to no mentality element and also up to no element of mental consciousness. There is no ignorance and no exhaustion of ignorance and so forth up to no ageing and death and no exhaustion of ageing and death. Likewise there is no suffering, origin, cessation or path; no exalted awareness, no attainment, and also no non-attainment.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">From this we can understand the meaning of the first equality, the equality of all conventional phenomena in lacking signs. In just the same way even though all phenomena have their own characteristics, even though some are not yet produced and some are already produced, even though some are to be accepted and others are to be rejected and even though some are things and some are non-things, all these phenomena are equally empty of inherent existence. They are mere <a id="calibre_link-1261"></a>elaborations &ndash; imputations of conceptual thought that do not appear to the wisdom of meditative equipoise of a Superior being. They have been separate from inherent existence from the very beginning and even though they can appear clearly to the mind they completely lack true existence like illusions, dreams, shadows, echoes, the moon in water, reflections and emanations. We should try to understand the ten equalities in this way.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">IDENTIFYING THE OBJECT OF NEGATION</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">According to the Madhyamika-Prasangika school, emptiness is lack of inherent existence, and therefore to realize emptiness we must negate inherent existence. Inherent existence is the <a id="calibre_link-1262"></a>object of negation and its non-existence is emptiness. In the sixth chapter of the <span class="italic">Guide</span> Chandrakirti presents many reasons proving the non-existence of inherently existent phenomena, but trying to apply this reasoning without first identifying the object of negation would be like firing a gun without knowing the target. The full impact of <a id="calibre_link-1263"></a>meditation on emptiness is achieved only when we clearly identify how inherently existent phenomena appear to our minds and then realize that there are no inherently existent phenomena. Thus, in <a id="calibre_link-1264"></a><span class="italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span> Shantideva says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Without first correctly identifying the object to be negated, true existence,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">You cannot apprehend its negation, or non-existence, emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">His meaning is that without first identifying the object to be negated &ndash; inherently existent phenomena that are projected by the mind &ndash; we will not be able to apprehend their non-existence, emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">To identify the object of negation of emptiness is to attain a clear mental image of inherently existent phenomena. We may think that it is impossible to have a mental image of a <a id="calibre_link-1265"></a>non-existent but if we close our eyes and picture a rabbit with a horn on its head we will see that it is perfectly possible. Indeed, it is only when we have a clear mental image of a horned rabbit that we can be certain such creatures do not exist. It is the same with realizing emptiness. We can know with certainty the non-existence of inherently existent phenomena only when we have a clear mental image of how inherently existent phenomena would be if they did exist.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The object of negation explained by the Madhyamika-Prasangika school, inherent existence, is very subtle and  difficult to identify, and the emptiness that is its non-existence is very subtle and difficult to realize. Therefore, as a first step, Buddha taught the less subtle view of the Madhyamika-Svatantrika school. The object of negation taught by this school is easier to identify and the emptiness that is its non-existence is easier to realize. Contemplating the view of the Madhyamika-Svatantrika school helps us to understand the more subtle view of the Madhyamika-Prasangika school.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">In describing the object of negation and emptiness both schools use similar terminology. For example, they both refer to the object of negation as ‘true existence’, and to emptiness as ‘lack of true existence’, but they each mean something different by these terms. For the Madhyamika-Svatantrikas something would be <a id="calibre_link-1266"></a>truly existent if it existed <span class="italic">wholly</span> independent of conceptual thought, whereas for the Madhyamika-Prasangikas something would be truly existent if it existed <span class="italic">in any way</span> independent of conceptual thought. Because they give different explanations of true existence, the object of negation, they also give different explanations of emptiness, the non-existence of the object of negation. The difference between these two explanations will now be explained under the following two headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Identifying the object of negation according to the Madhyamika-Svatantrika school</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">Many of the great masters of the Madhyamika-Svatantrika school composed commentaries to Nagarjuna’s <a id="calibre_link-1269"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> interpreting it from the point of view of Madhyamika-Svatantrika tenets. The most well-known of these commentaries are <a id="calibre_link-1270"></a><span class="italic">Lamp for Wisdom</span> by Bhavaviveka, <a id="calibre_link-1271"></a><span class="italic">Discrimination of the Two Truths</span> by Gyanagarbha, <a id="calibre_link-1272"></a><span class="italic">Ornament for the Middle Way</span> by Shantirakshita, and <a id="calibre_link-1273"></a><span class="italic">Illumination of the Middle Way</span> by Kamalashila. The following presentation of the object of negation according to the Madhyamika-Svatantrika school is derived from the last of these.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">According to the <a id="calibre_link-1274"></a>Madhyamika-Svatantrikas, existing in dependence on appearing to mind, existing nominally, and existing conventionally are synonyms. All phenomena exist in dependence on appearing to mind, all phenomena exist nominally and all phenomena exist conventionally. Being conceived by mind and being <a id="calibre_link-1275"></a>imputed by mind are also synonyms. All phenomena are conceived by mind and all phenomena are imputed by mind. Moreover, all phenomena exist in dependence on being conceived by mind, and all phenomena exist in dependence on being imputed by mind.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">If something existed without being conceived by mind it would be <a id="calibre_link-1276"></a>truly existent. No phenomenon is truly existent. True existence is the object of negation of emptiness and lack of true existence is emptiness. Any mind that apprehends true existence is a true-grasping mind. This is the criterion of true existence and <a id="calibre_link-1277"></a>true-grasping according to the Madhyamika-Svatantrika school.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Madhyamika-Svatantrikas do not assert that phenomena are merely imputed by mind. They say that even though phenomena exist in dependence on being imputed by mind they also exist from their own side and therefore are inherently existent. If phenomena did not exist from their own side at all, if they were mere imputations of mind, they would not exist. Therefore, phenomena do not exist entirely from their own side, but they also do not exist entirely from the side of the mind.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">In so far as the Madhyamika-Svatantrikas assert that phenomena do not exist entirely from their own side their view is much more subtle than the views of the lower schools, but in so far as they assert that phenomena exist from their own side their view is not as subtle as the view of the Madhyamika-Prasangika school. According to the Madhyamika-Prasangikas, phenomena are merely imputed by conceptual thought and do not exist from their own side in the least. Compared with this view, the view of the Madhyamika-Svatantrika school is gross.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">EXPLAINING TRUE AND FALSE WITH REFERENCE TO WORLDLY PEOPLE BY MEANS OF AN ANALOGY</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The <a id="calibre_link-1278"></a>Madhyamika-Svatantrikas assert that emptiness is ultimate truth and that all other phenomena are conventional truths. This means that <a id="calibre_link-1279"></a>emptiness alone is a <a id="calibre_link-1280"></a>true object and all other phenomena are <a id="calibre_link-1281"></a>false objects. Thus they would say that this book, which is a <a id="calibre_link-1282"></a>conventional truth, is a false object whereas its emptiness, which is an ultimate truth, is a true object. In saying that the book is a false object they do not mean that it is not a book or that it does not exist. They explain what they mean by <a id="calibre_link-1283"></a>true and false by referring to the way these terms are used by ordinary people, and to help us understand this they use the <a id="calibre_link-1284"></a>analogy of a magician’s horse.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In ancient times magicians could conjure up appearances such as animals or people by blowing <a id="calibre_link-1285"></a>mantras on a substance and then applying that substance to an object such as a stone or a tree. We can imagine a situation in which one such <a id="calibre_link-1286"></a>magician has conjured up the appearance of a horse. In the case of an ordinary member of the audience who is taken in by the spell the horse appears to be real and he conceives it to be a real horse. In the case of the magician himself a horse also appears to his mind but he is not taken in by the spell and so he does not conceive it to be a real horse. In the case of a member of the audience with great wisdom whose mind is not affected by the spell there is no appearance of a horse to his mind and he does not conceive there to be a real horse.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">These three people &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-1287"></a>ordinary member of the audience, the magician and the wise member of the audience whose mind is not affected by the spell &ndash; are analogous to <a id="calibre_link-1288"></a>living beings who have not realized emptiness, living beings who have realized emptiness and Buddhas respectively. In the case of a living being who has not realized emptiness this book, for example, will appear as truly existent and he or she will assent to that appearance by conceiving it to be truly existent. In the case of a living being who has realized emptiness, because he has not yet abandoned <a id="calibre_link-1289"></a>obstructions to omniscience this book will still <a id="calibre_link-1290"></a>appear to his mind as truly existent, but because he has realized emptiness he will not believe that appearance and he will not conceive the book to be truly existent. This is rather like someone watching a film about mountains who, although there appears to be a mountain in the room, does not think that there actually is a mountain in the room. In the case of a <a id="calibre_link-1291"></a>Buddha, who has attained a direct realization of lack of true existence and abandoned obstructions to omniscience there is no appearance of a truly existent book, and he or she does not conceive there to be a truly existent book.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">When an <a id="calibre_link-1292"></a>ordinary being looks at a book, both the book and a truly existent book appear to his or her mind. In reality there is no truly existent book so the way the book appears does not correspond to the way it exists. This lack of correspondence between the way it appears and the way it exists indicates that the book is a deceptive object, a false object. It is perfectly normal to say that something is false if it appears in one way and exists in another; indeed this is precisely the criterion of falsity used by ordinary people. For example, ordinary people would accept that a reflection of a face is deceptive, or false, because there appears to be a face where no face exists. Similarly, they would say that a theory is false if it does not correspond to the facts. By using this criterion of falsity we can see how all phenomena other than emptiness are false objects because they all appear to be truly existent when they are not.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-1293"></a>Emptiness, on the other hand, is a <a id="calibre_link-1294"></a>true object because the way it appears corresponds to the way it exists. When emptiness appears directly to the mind only lack of true existence is perceived. Whereas a book, for example, appears to a non-conceptual <a id="calibre_link-1295"></a>direct perceiver mixed with the <a id="calibre_link-1296"></a>appearance of a truly existent book, emptiness appears to a non-conceptual direct perceiver without the appearance of true existence. What appears is only emptiness, or lack of true existence, and what exists is only emptiness, or lack of true existence. Since the way it appears to a non-conceptual direct perceiver corresponds to the way it exists, emptiness is a true object.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Again, it is perfectly normal to say that something is true if the way it appears corresponds to the way it exists, and this is precisely the criterion of truth used by ordinary people. For example, ordinary people say that a person is being true if he presents himself as he is. However, it is important to realize that such a person is true only with respect to the minds of worldly people who have not realized emptiness. In reality, that person is not true because he appears to be truly existent when he is not. <a id="calibre_link-1297"></a>Worldly people do not realize that the appearance of a truly existent person is a <a id="calibre_link-1298"></a>mistaken <a id="calibre_link-1299"></a>appearance, which is why they say that the person appears the way he is. However, Superior beings who have a direct realization of emptiness realize that the appearance of a truly existent person is a mistaken appearance because it does not correspond to the way he exists.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Thus, what is true for worldly beings is false for Superior beings. Who is correct, worldly beings or Superior beings? Superior beings are correct because they possess <a id="calibre_link-1300"></a>uncontaminated minds. Only the <a id="calibre_link-1301"></a>exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of <a id="calibre_link-1302"></a>Superior beings directly realizing emptiness is an uncontaminated mind free from pollution by true-grasping and its <a id="calibre_link-1303"></a>imprints. The direct perceivers of ordinary beings, on the other hand, are contaminated minds polluted by true-grasping and its imprints.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Another reason why <a id="calibre_link-1304"></a>conventional phenomena are false objects is that they appear to be different natures from their parts when in reality they are not. All phenomena have parts because whatever is a phenomenon is either a thing or a <a id="calibre_link-1305"></a>non-thing and all things have parts and all non-things have parts. Whatever is a thing is either a <a id="calibre_link-1306"></a>form or a <a id="calibre_link-1307"></a>formless thing and all forms have parts and all formless things have parts. All forms have parts because they are composed of particles. Some <a id="calibre_link-1308"></a>Vaibhashika and <a id="calibre_link-1309"></a>Sautrantika schools assert that the tiniest <a id="calibre_link-1310"></a>particles do not have parts because they are physically indivisible, but according to the Madhyamika school they have directional parts and so are mentally divisible. If even the smallest forms have parts it follows that all gross forms that are composed of them also have parts.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Similarly, all formless things have parts. For example, mind is a thing because it is an <a id="calibre_link-1311"></a>impermanent phenomenon produced from causes and conditions, and it is formless because it always lacks form. All <a id="calibre_link-1312"></a>minds have temporal parts because they have former and later moments. They also have parts from the point of view of how they apprehend their objects. An eye consciousness apprehending the colours of a mosaic, for example, has many parts because it has one part apprehending blue, one part apprehending green and so on.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Non-things are <a id="calibre_link-1313"></a>permanent phenomena that are uncaused such as <a id="calibre_link-1314"></a>unproduced space and emptiness. Unproduced space has parts because there is the space inside a house, the space outside a house and so on. <a id="calibre_link-1315"></a>Emptiness has parts because there is the emptiness of a book, the emptiness of a chair and so on. By extension we can understand how all other non-things have parts.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">All phenomena are the same nature as their parts. For example, a car has many parts but it is not a different nature from those parts. If it were, it would be possible to destroy all the parts of the car without destroying the car, but this is not possible. However, when we think of a car we perceive a vividly appearing car that is a different nature from its parts. Since the way the car appears does not correspond to the way it exists the car is a false object. In this way we can understand how all conventional phenomena are false objects.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">APPLYING THIS ANALOGY TO THE MEANING</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">In the analogy given above, the eye consciousness of the ordinary member of the audience is contaminated by the magician’s spell. As a result, he sees a horse that appears to be real and, assenting to that appearance, conceives it to be a real horse. This is analogous to <a id="calibre_link-1316"></a>ordinary living beings who have not realized emptiness. All their minds are <a id="calibre_link-1317"></a>contaminated by the ignorance of true-grasping and as a result phenomena appear to their minds to be truly existent and they conceive them to be truly existent. Just as the ordinary member of the magician’s audience believes what he sees to be true, so living beings who have not realized emptiness grasp at the truly existent phenomena that appear to their minds as true. Even after living beings have realized emptiness they still have obstructions to omniscience, which cause phenomena to <a id="calibre_link-1318"></a>appear to be truly existent. However, through the force of their <a id="calibre_link-1319"></a>realization of emptiness they do not assent to this appearance and so do not conceive phenomena to be truly existent. They become like the magician to whom a horse appears as if it were a real horse but who, because he is not taken in by the spell, does not assent to that appearance and does not conceive it to be a real horse.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">When <a id="calibre_link-1320"></a>living beings realize emptiness directly and their minds mix with emptiness in meditative equipoise, all <a id="calibre_link-1321"></a>dualistic appearance subsides into emptiness and only emptiness appears to their mind. While they are in meditative equipoise they become like the wise member of the audience to whom no horse appears and who does not conceive there to be a real horse. However, for as long as they remain living beings they have not abandoned <a id="calibre_link-1322"></a>obstructions to omniscience and so when they rise from meditative equipoise phenomena again appear to them as truly existent. In other words, when they rise from meditation they become like the magician again. When they finally abandon obstructions to omniscience and attain Buddhahood, both the appearance of true existence and the conception of true existence cease completely and they remain for all time like the wise member of the audience.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The analogy of the magician’s spell was introduced by the Madhyamika-Svatantrikas because such magicians were commonplace in India at the time. However this is not the only analogy we can use. There are many other <a id="calibre_link-1323"></a>analogies that illustrate how phenomena appear to be <a id="calibre_link-1324"></a>truly existent when they are not such as mistaking a pleasant encounter in a dream for a real encounter, mistaking a monster in a film for a real monster, mistaking a pile of stones in the distance for a person, or mistaking a mark on the wall for a spider. The scriptures also use analogies such as mirages, <a id="calibre_link-1325"></a>emanations, echoes and reflections.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">IDENTIFYING THE <a id="calibre_link-1326"></a>OBJECT OF NEGATION ACCORDING TO THE MADHYAMIKA-PRASANGIKA SCHOOL</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">As we have seen, the <a id="calibre_link-1327"></a>Madhyamika-Svatantrikas say that all phenomena lack <a id="calibre_link-1328"></a>true existence because they do not exist entirely from their own side, but they do not lack inherent existence because they do exist from their own side to some extent. The Madhyamika-Prasangikas disagree. They say that all phenomena without exception are merely imputed by thought and do not exist from their own side in the least. They say that if there were any sense in which phenomena existed from their own side they would be truly existent. In other words, if something were inherently existent it would be truly existent. No phenomenon is inherently existent. The <a id="calibre_link-1329"></a>object of negation of emptiness, therefore, is inherent existence, or existence from its own side. Any mind that apprehends inherently existent phenomena is a <a id="calibre_link-1330"></a>true-grasping mind and a <a id="calibre_link-1331"></a>wrong awareness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">According to the Madhyamika-Prasangikas, therefore, to realize emptiness we must realize the non-existence of inherent existence, and to do this we must know what inherently existent phenomena would be like if they did exist. To identify this subtle object of negation, <a id="calibre_link-1332"></a>inherent existence, we first need to understand how all phenomena are merely imputed by conceptual thought. There are three ways in which we can understand this, which will now be explained under the following three headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Understanding mere <a id="calibre_link-1333"></a>imputation by means of scriptures</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	Understanding mere imputation by means of analogies</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">3	Understanding mere imputation by means of reasoning</p>
			<p class="text-heading">UNDERSTANDING MERE IMPUTATION BY MEANS OF SCRIPTURES</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">There are many scriptures that explain how all phenomena are merely imputed by thought. For example, in <a id="calibre_link-1334"></a><span class="italic">Sutra Requested by Upali</span> Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">There is nothing that is the creator</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Of the various attractive flowers that bloom,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Or the beautiful, glistening, supreme golden houses;</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">For they are all established by the power of conception;</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">All worlds are imputed by conception.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">There is an infinite number of worlds and some, like the worlds of the gods, are very beautiful. In these worlds the houses are made of gold and glistening jewels and they stand in beautiful gardens of exquisite flowers. Other worlds, including parts of the human and animal worlds, are unattractive. Inhabiting all these different worlds is a great variety of living beings. All these worlds and all their inhabitants are merely imputed by thought. They have no creator other than conceptual mind.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Some people believe that this world was created by <a id="calibre_link-1335"></a>Brahma, a worldly god inhabiting the first form realm. Brahma’s world evolved before the human world evolved and when the inhabitants of his world saw the human world evolving out of empty space beneath theirs they naturally assumed it was the work of Brahma. Some were subsequently reborn as humans and, because they still had the imprint of this belief, again developed the view that this world was created by Brahma. Some have composed books setting out this belief.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">If we examine carefully, however, we will see that there is no creator of the <a id="calibre_link-1336"></a>world other than mind. The subtle conventional nature of the world is its being mere imputation by conceptual thought. No matter how much we search, we will never find a world that is independent of conceptual imputation. Therefore the world depends entirely on mind for its existence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">As with all other things, this world came into being in dependence on causes. Had there been no causes there would be no world. The main cause of this world was the collective <a id="calibre_link-1337"></a>karma of the beings who inhabit it. Since karma originates in the mind it follows that this world was produced principally by mind. The creation of the world also required secondary, or co-operative, causes, such as the amassing of atomic particles. At one time this universe was just empty space, then one atom appeared and gradually particles amassed to form the universe as we know it. Where did the first atom come from? It can only have been produced by the collective karma of the beings inhabiting this world. There is no valid reason for saying that it was created by Brahma or by any other god. The entire world arose due to karma and karma arises from mind; therefore the actual creator of this world is mind.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">UNDERSTANDING MERE IMPUTATION BY MEANS OF <a id="calibre_link-1338"></a>ANALOGIES</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Chandrakirti, in his commentary to Aryadeva’s <a id="calibre_link-1339"></a><span class="italic">Four Hundred</span> and Je Tsongkhapa in <a id="calibre_link-1340"></a><span class="italic">Clear Illumination of the Intention</span> use the <a id="calibre_link-1341"></a>analogy of an imagined snake to show how all phenomena are merely imputed by thought. A man walking through a field at dusk comes across a coil of speckled rope in the grass and, mistaking it for a <a id="calibre_link-1342"></a>snake, develops fear. Even though a snake appears vividly to his mind that snake does not exist from its own side. It is merely a projection of his mind, imputed by conceptual thought in dependence on the rope. Other than this, no snake can be found because neither the coil of rope as a whole nor any part of it is a snake.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In just the same way, all phenomena are merely imputed by conceptual thought. For example, the I does not exist from its own side; it is merely a projection of the mind imputed by conceptual thought in dependence on the <a id="calibre_link-1343"></a>aggregates. If we try to find an I other than the mere conceptual imputation ‘I’ we will not succeed because neither the collection of the aggregates nor any individual aggregate is the I. Existing phenomena such as the I differ from the imagined snake in that they are valid <a id="calibre_link-1344"></a>imputations, but there is no difference from the point of view of their being merely imputed by conceptual thought.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In the <a id="calibre_link-1345"></a>analogy, because the man sees the rope in the twilight he mistakenly apprehends a snake and develops fear. To remove this fear he must remove the mind apprehending a snake by realizing that there is no snake. Even then, if the rope is left in the same place there is a danger that he will make the same mistake in the future. The only way to remove this danger is to remove the rope. Similarly, living beings observing their aggregates in the darkness of their ignorance mistakenly apprehend an inherently existent I. This mind <a id="calibre_link-1346"></a>grasping at an inherently existent I is the root of <a id="calibre_link-1347"></a>samsara and the source of all fear. To remove the fears of samsara we must remove this mind by realizing that there is no inherently existent I. Even then, there will be a danger of the mind <a id="calibre_link-1348"></a>grasping at an inherently existent I recurring if we continue to grasp at inherently existent aggregates. Therefore, the only way to remove the fears of samsara entirely is first to realize the lack of inherent existence of the I and then to realize the lack of inherent existence of the aggregates.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Again, we can use other analogies such as seeing a spider on a wall where there is only a mark, seeing a person in the distance where there is only a pile of stones or generating fear during a movie. By contemplating these analogies we can understand how all phenomena are merely imputed by thought.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">UNDERSTANDING MERE IMPUTATION BY MEANS OF REASONING</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">To begin with, we should try to understand how our own I is <a id="calibre_link-1349"></a>merely imputed by conceptual thought. We can do this by relying on the following reasoning. If the I were not merely imputed by conceptual thought it would exist from its own side, and if it existed from its own side it would be found on investigation. However, if we are not satisfied with the mere conceptual imputation ‘I’ and search for an I we will not find one either within the aggregates or separate from the aggregates. Therefore the I does not exist from its own side but is merely <a id="calibre_link-1350"></a>imputed by conceptual thought. Once we understand how our own I is merely imputed, we can extend our investigation to other living beings and then to all other phenomena. In this way we will gradually come to see how all phenomena are merely imputed by conceptual thought.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">By relying on scriptures, analogies and reasoning we will realize that all phenomena are merely imputed by conceptual thought. In this context the word ‘merely’ excludes any mode of existence other than being imputed by conceptual thought. Phenomena do not exist from their own side in any sense whatsoever. If a phenomenon were not merely imputed by conceptual thought but existed from its own side in any way it would be inherently existent. No phenomenon is inherently existent. Inherent existence is the subtle <a id="calibre_link-1351"></a>object of negation of emptiness and its non-existence is emptiness, ultimate truth.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">‘<a id="calibre_link-1352"></a>Inherent existence’, ‘<a id="calibre_link-1353"></a>true existence’ and ‘natural existence’ all mean the same and all are objects of negation. Once we have a clear <a id="calibre_link-1354"></a>generic image of the object of negation we should strive to <a id="calibre_link-1355"></a>realize its non-existence, emptiness. The method for realizing lack of inherent existence is the reasoning presented in the sixth chapter of the <span class="italic">Guide</span> such as the reasoning of <a id="calibre_link-1356"></a>vajra fragments and the <a id="calibre_link-1357"></a>sevenfold reasoning. When through relying on this reasoning we realize that there are no inherently existent phenomena at all we will have realized emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Whereas inherent existence, or <a id="calibre_link-1358"></a>true existence, is the object of negation, grasping at inherent existence, or <a id="calibre_link-1359"></a>true-grasping, is the principal object to be abandoned. This mind is the source of all <a id="calibre_link-1360"></a>suffering and the root of <a id="calibre_link-1361"></a>samsara. It is important to be clear about what the object to be abandoned is because there are many misunderstandings concerning this. One such misunderstanding that was promoted in Tibet by the Chinese monk <a id="calibre_link-1362"></a>Hashang is still current today and is a great obstacle to spiritual development. Hashang was a follower of Buddha but he completely misunderstood Buddha’s teachings on emptiness and spread a dangerous heresy among the Tibetan people. According to Hashang, since truly existent phenomena appear to all conceptual <a id="calibre_link-1363"></a>minds, all conceptual minds are objects to be abandoned. He said that just as all dogs hurt when they bite, regardless of whether they are white dogs or black dogs, so all conceptual minds harm us regardless of whether they are virtuous minds or non-virtuous minds. Similarly, just as both white and black clouds obscure the sun, so both virtuous and non-virtuous conceptual minds obscure our mind. The ultimate view of emptiness is attained by preventing all conceptual minds and allowing the mind to go blank. This, Hashang claimed, was the actual meaning of Buddha’s teachings on emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Before Hashang came to Tibet a very pure Buddhadharma flourished there. Many people correctly identified the middle way and as a result gained profound realizations. However, Hashang’s view quickly spread and as a result many Tibetans found themselves without the means to practise either the profound path or the vast path. By meditating on nothingness instead of emptiness they had forsaken the <a id="calibre_link-1364"></a>profound path, and by abandoning all conceptual minds including love, compassion and bodhichitta, they had forsaken the <a id="calibre_link-1365"></a>vast path. The path to enlightenment was blocked for them. Even the practice of observing the laws of karma was lost.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Seeing this, King <a id="calibre_link-1366"></a>Trisong Detsen, the thirty-seventh king of Tibet, invited <a id="calibre_link-1367"></a>Kamalashila from India to debate with Hashang. Kamalashila conclusively defeated Hashang and Hashang was banished from Tibet. King Trisong Detsen then issued a proclamation declaring that from then on all Tibetans were to follow the teachings of <a id="calibre_link-1368"></a>Nagarjuna. However, Hashang’s heresy was not completely expunged and even today there are many who advocate this view.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Hashang’s <a id="calibre_link-1369"></a>wrong views arose from an inability to identify both the object of negation of emptiness and the principal object to be abandoned. If we also fail to identify these clearly there is a danger of these wrong views persisting and blocking the spiritual development of this and future generations. Therefore we should be very clear about what is the object to be negated and what is the object to be abandoned. The object of negation is <a id="calibre_link-1370"></a>true existence, which is existence in any way independent of conceptual imputation, and the object to be abandoned is <a id="calibre_link-1371"></a><a id="calibre_link-1372"></a>true-grasping, which is a conceptual mind that apprehends, or conceives, true existence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Although true existence appears to all conceptual <a id="calibre_link-1373"></a>minds, not all conceptual minds apprehend, or conceive, true existence. Only conceptual minds that conceive true existence are true-grasping minds. Virtuous minds such as love, compassion and bodhichitta are conceptual minds but they are not true-grasping minds and so they are not objects to be abandoned. Only by understanding such distinctions can we practise both the <a id="calibre_link-1374"></a>profound path, which is the cause of the <a id="calibre_link-1375"></a>Truth Body of a Buddha, and the <a id="calibre_link-1376"></a>vast path, which is the cause of the <a id="calibre_link-1377"></a>Form Body of a Buddha, and thereby attain full enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Another area of misunderstanding is the type of negation that is realized. Some say that when we realize emptiness we realize an affirming negative but this is incorrect. Emptiness is not an affirming negative but a non-affirming negative.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are two types of phenomenon &ndash; <a id="calibre_link-1378"></a>affirmative phenomena and <a id="calibre_link-1379"></a>negative phenomena. Affirmative phenomena are objects such as people, chairs, tables and so forth that are realized without the mind explicitly eliminating an object of negation. A negative phenomenon is a phenomenon that is realized through the explicit elimination of the phenomenon’s object of negation by the mind that apprehends that phenomenon. There are two types of <a id="calibre_link-1380"></a><a id="calibre_link-1381"></a>negative phenomenon &ndash; affirming negatives and non-affirming negatives. An affirming negative is a negative phenomenon realized by a mind that eliminates its object of negation while realizing another phenomenon. An example is a well-fed man’s not eating during the day. A mind that realizes this explicitly eliminates the object of negation, his eating during the day, while implicitly realizing another phenomenon &ndash; that he must eat during the night! Another example is the opposite of non-pot because the mind that realizes this explicitly eliminates the object of negation, non-pot, while implicitly realizing pot.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">A non-affirming negative is a negative phenomenon realized by a mind that merely eliminates its object of negation without realizing another phenomenon. The absence of a horn on a rabbit’s head is an example of a non-affirming negative because the mind that realizes this merely eliminates the object of negation, a horn on a rabbit’s head, without realizing another phenomenon. All emptinesses are non-affirming negatives. For example, <a id="calibre_link-1382"></a><a id="calibre_link-1383"></a>selflessness of persons is a non-affirming negative because the mind that realizes it merely eliminates the object of negation, an inherently existent person, without realizing another phenomenon. Similarly, <a id="calibre_link-1384"></a><a id="calibre_link-1385"></a>selflessness of phenomena is a non-affirming negative because the mind that realizes it merely eliminates the object of negation, inherently existent phenomena, without realizing another phenomenon.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Generally, non-affirming negatives are quite difficult to understand, and there are many who mistakenly think that there is no object to be realized in a mere negation. If we want to realize emptiness, however, we must strive to understand the real nature of non-affirming negatives. Previously in Tibet many Teachers failed to distinguish between a non-affirming negative and non-existence and as a result they strayed from <a id="calibre_link-1386"></a>Nagarjuna’s view. This may still be the case today. To avoid making such mistakes we need to study clear and practical instructions on how to identify the object of negation, such as those found in the books <a id="calibre_link-1387"></a><span class="italic">Joyful Path of Good Fortune</span>, <a id="calibre_link-1388"></a><span class="italic">Meaningful to Behold</span>, <span class="italic">The </span><span class="italic"><a id="calibre_link-1389"></a></span><span class="italic">New Meditation Handbook</span>, <span class="italic">The </span><span class="italic"><a id="calibre_link-1390"></a></span><span class="italic">New Heart of Wisdom</span> and <span class="italic">The </span><span class="italic"><a id="calibre_link-1391"></a></span><span class="italic">Oral Instructions of Mahamudra</span>.</p>

			<p class="text-heading">ESTABLISHING THE MEANING OF THE SCRIPTURES BY REASONING</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This section has two parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Establishing selflessness of phenomena by reasoning</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Establishing selflessness of persons by reasoning</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ESTABLISHING SELFLESSNESS OF PHENOMENA BY REASONING</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">As we will see later, Buddha explained many divisions of emptiness, or selflessness, but the principal division is a twofold division into <a id="calibre_link-1396"></a>selflessness of persons and <a id="calibre_link-1397"></a>selflessness of phenomena. Selflessness of persons is the lack of inherent existence of persons, and selflessness of phenomena is the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena other than persons. These two selflessnesses are distinguished only from the point of view of their bases, not from the point of view of their nature. All selflessnesses are the same nature, mere absence of inherent existence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In <span class="italic">Condensed </span><span class="italic"><a id="calibre_link-1398"></a></span><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutra</span> Buddha says that we should know all other living beings as we know our self and we should know all other phenomena as we know living beings. This means that we should first realize the emptiness of our self, then the emptiness of other persons and then the emptiness of phenomena other than persons. In other words, we should first realize selflessness of persons and then selflessness of phenomena. Chandrakirti, however, presents selflessness of phenomena first. His purpose is to dislodge the strong adherence to inherent existence in the minds of those who propound tenets lower than the Madhyamika-Prasangikas. Proponents of lower tenets hold tightly to the view of inherent existence mainly because they cannot understand how it is possible for things to be produced from causes if neither cause nor effect exists from its own side. For them, the very fact that causes produce effects proves that causes and effects exist from their own side and therefore that they are inherently existent. To remove this wrong conception Chandrakirti begins with a refutation of inherently existent production.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Establishing selflessness of phenomena by reasoning has four parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Refuting the <a id="calibre_link-1399"></a>four extremes of production within both truths</p>

			<p class="text-heading">REFUTING THE FOUR EXTREMES OF PRODUCTION WITHIN BOTH TRUTHS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">There are many ways to refute <a id="calibre_link-1400"></a>inherently existent production but the most powerful method is the refutation of the four extremes of production. This refutation is known as ‘<a id="calibre_link-1401"></a>vajra fragments’ because just as a vajra is so powerful that even one fragment can shatter a mountain, so this reasoning is extremely powerful in destroying the conception of inherently existent production. The reasoning is presented in three parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	There is no inherently existent production</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	Proving this by reasoning</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Also it is not from both; how can it be without a cause?</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The reasoning of vajra fragments is as follows. Things are not inherently produced because they are not produced from self, from other, from both self and other or without a cause. Production from self, from other, from both self and other and without a cause are called ‘extremes’ because to assert any of these positions is to fall into the extreme of existence. These four extremes exhaust all possibilities of inherently existent production and since none of them exists there is no inherently existent production.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Production from self is asserted by the <a id="calibre_link-1402"></a>Samkhya school, the oldest of the Brahmaic schools, production from other is asserted by some non-Buddhist schools and by all Buddhist schools below the Madhyamika-Prasangikas, production from both self and other is asserted by some sections of the Samkhya school and by the <a id="calibre_link-1403"></a>Jains, and production without a cause is asserted by the <a id="calibre_link-1404"></a>Charavaka school, a nihilist school.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para"><a id="calibre_link-1408"></a><a id="calibre_link-1409"></a><span class="italic">Samkhyas</span> We assert production from self because effects are produced from causes that are the <a id="calibre_link-1410"></a>same entity as themselves. For example, when a barley seed meets with appropriate conditions such as moisture and warmth a barley sprout is produced. Although the seed is the cause and the sprout is its effect they are both the same entity, or nature. Since a sprout is produced from a seed that is the same entity as itself there is production from self.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The refutation of this position is in two parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Refuting production from a cause that is the same entity</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">If a sprout is the same entity as its seed it follows that it has already been produced at the time of the seed, and it is not reasonable to assert that what has already been produced is produced again. If you assert that what is already produced is produced again then two consequences follow. First, sprouts and so forth will never be produced because the production of a sprout follows the cessation of its seed and seeds that are forever being produced never cease. Second, once a seed is produced it is produced again, and having been produced again it must be produced yet again and so on. Therefore it follows that the production of seeds is endless and so seeds will continue to be produced until the end of time.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">REFUTING A DENIAL OF THESE FAULTS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Samkhyas</span> We do not have to accept either of the foregoing consequences because we can see clearly that sprouts are produced and that seeds cease. A sprout is produced when its cause, the seed, meets with conditions such as moisture and warmth and in being produced it causes the seed to disintegrate.</p>

However, even worldly people can see that they are different; therefore a cause and its effect are not the same entity.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">REFUTING A DENIAL OF THIS FAULT</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Samkhyas</span> We do not incur this fault because when a seed produces a sprout its previous nature is destroyed and it becomes a different entity.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">If in producing the sprout the seed’s previous nature is destroyed and it becomes a different entity, how can the seed be the same nature as the sprout at that time? Surely it is contradictory to say that a seed and its sprout are the same nature and yet the seed must change its nature to transform into the sprout.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">IT FOLLOWS THAT BOTH THE SEED AND THE SPROUT ARE SIMILAR IN BEING EITHER APPREHENDABLE OR UNAPPREHENDABLE AT ANY ONE TIME</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Or, since they are the same, that is also apprehendable just like the sprout.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Therefore you should not assert this.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">If two visual objects are the same nature they must be produced simultaneously and disintegrate simultaneously. When one appears to sense awareness the other also appears, and if one does not appear to sense awareness the other also does not appear. You Samkhyas assert that a seed is the same nature as its sprout. If that is so then at the time of the sprout either the sprout does not appear to sense awareness just like the seed or the seed appears to sense awareness just like the sprout. Since neither is the case you should not assert that a seed and its sprout are the same nature.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">EVEN WORLDLY PEOPLE WHOSE MINDS ARE NOT AFFECTED BY TENETS DO NOT ASSERT PRODUCTION FROM SELF</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Since they are not one, production from self should not be asserted</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Because of the consequences extensively explained.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">If production from self is asserted, it follows that a cause and its effect are inherently the same nature and so are identical in all respects. Thus a product, such as a sprout and its producer, the seed, are inherently one. As Nagarjuna says in <a id="calibre_link-1415"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span>:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">The oneness of cause and effect</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Is not acceptable at any time.</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">If cause and effect are one,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Then product and producer are one.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Furthermore it follows that an object and its agent are also inherently one. Again, Nagarjuna says in <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span>:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">If wood and fire are one,</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last">Object and agent are one.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Since a product and its producer are not one and an object and its agent are not one, production from self should not be asserted. Those who assert production from self incur all the consequences extensively explained in <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> and <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">At this point it is customary to study a detailed debate that arises out of differing interpretations of Nagarjuna’s refutation of production from self. The debate is long and complex and there is not the space here to consider it at length, but it might be helpful briefly to outline the main points.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The participants are three of Nagarjuna’s disciples &ndash; <a id="calibre_link-1416"></a>Buddhapalita, <a id="calibre_link-1417"></a>Bhavaviveka and Chandrakirti. In his commentary to <a id="calibre_link-1418"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> Buddhapalita refutes the Samkhyas’ assertion of production from self by means of two consequences. His actual words are:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">There is no production of things from self because their production would be pointless and because extreme <a id="calibre_link-1419"></a>consequences would follow. A thing that exists in its own entity has no need of production. If, even though it exists, it is produced, it will never not be produced.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Buddhapalita’s first consequence is: it follows that if things already exist in the entity of their own cause their production again is pointless. The second consequence is: it follows that if a thing already exists and yet must be produced again it is never not being produced and so its production is endless.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Bhavaviveka analyzes this reasoning in <a id="calibre_link-1420"></a><span class="italic">Lamp for Wisdom </span>and finds three faults. His first criticism is that Buddhapalita fails to provide a reason and an example that are capable of refuting the Samkhyas’ position. He does not find Buddhapalita’s consequences adequate and seeks to reconstruct them in the form of autonomous <a id="calibre_link-1421"></a>syllogisms, that is syllogisms in which the three modes &ndash; the property of the subject, the forward pervasion and the reverse pervasion &ndash; inherently exist in the reason and in which the three terms &ndash; the subject, the predicate, and the reason &ndash; inherently exist and appear commonly to both parties in the debate. Bhavaviveka finds the autonomous syllogisms reconstructed from Buddhapalita’s reasoning unsuitable and proposes an alternative syllogism for refuting production from self:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">The subjects, the inner sources such as an eye sense power, are not ultimately produced from self because of existing &ndash; like, for example, existent consciousness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Bhavaviveka’s second criticism is that Buddhapalita’s consequences do not counter the mistaken reasoning of the Samkhyas because they fail to prove to a Samkhya that there is no production from self. His third criticism is that the probanda of the syllogisms reconstructed from Buddhapalita’s consequences affirm production from other and so contradicts the Madhyamika tenet that the negation of the four extremes of production is a non-affirming negative.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In his commentary to <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> called <a id="calibre_link-1422"></a><span class="italic">Clear Words</span>, Chandrakirti rejects all three of Bhavaviveka’s criticisms. To the first point Chandrakirti replies that Buddhapalita’s consequences are perfectly capable of causing a Samkhya to abandon the view of production from self because they clearly reveal contradictions within the Samkhyas’ position. If after contemplating these contradictions a Samkhya were to continue to hold to the view of production from self there would be no point in stating reasons and examples to convince him because he would already have shown himself to be unreasonable. Moreover, even if reasons were used they could not be stated in the form of autonomous syllogisms because inherently existent reasons possessing the three modes do not exist and it is quite wrong for a Madhyamika to assert them.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">By analyzing Buddhapalita’s own explanation of his consequences, Chandrakirti shows that Bhavaviveka’s second criticism is also invalid because both consequences are addressed to the fallacies in the Samkhyas’ reasoning. Chandrakirti turns the criticism around and shows how it is Bhavaviveka’s syllogism that is inadequate in this respect.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">As far as Bhavaviveka’s third criticism is concerned, Chandrakirti points out that it is based on the misunderstanding that Buddhapalita is obliged to accept the opposite of his consequences. Chandrakirti shows that not all consequences imply their opposite. Buddhapalita merely refutes production from self and does not affirm production from other.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Having defended Buddhapalita, Chandrakirti goes on to attack Bhavaviveka’s general position, thereby throwing into relief the essential differences between the <a id="calibre_link-1423"></a>Madhyamika-Prasangika and <a id="calibre_link-1424"></a>Madhyamika-Svatantrika schools. Chandrakirti first points out that there is no justification for Bhavaviveka’s inclusion of the term ‘ultimately’ in his proposed syllogism because this is the occasion for refuting production from self and production from self does not exist either conventionally or ultimately. He then refutes the basic assumption underlying Bhavaviveka’s use of autonomous syllogisms, that the subject of a syllogism appears commonly to both parties in a debate. Chandrakirti shows that the subject of a syllogism cannot appear to a non-Madhyamika-Prasangika in the same way that it appears to a Madhyamika-Prasangika because for a non-Madhyamika-Prasangika it will appear to be certified as inherently existent by a valid cognizer whereas for a Madhyamika-Prasangika it will not.</p>

Whereas all Buddhist schools refute production from self, production from both self and other and production without a cause, the proponents of things do not refute production from other. In this context, ‘production from other’ means not simply production from other causes but production from <span class="italic">inherently existent other</span> causes. Conventionally all things are produced from causes that are other than themselves, but nothing is produced from inherently existent other causes.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The proponents of things believe that if <a id="calibre_link-1435"></a>causes were not inherently existent they would not be able to produce their effects. Therefore they assert that things are produced from inherently existent other causes. They support their belief with a quotation from Sutra where Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">The causes of things are the four conditions that exist by way of their own characteristics.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Thus they believe that causes and effects are inherently existent and inherently other. This assertion of production from other is now extensively refuted by the Madhyamika-Prasangikas.</p>

Indeed everything whether effect or not arises from everything whether cause or not because a non-cause is similar to a cause in that both are inherently existent other than and completely unrelated to the effect.

Likewise something that can be produced from another thing is correctly called the effect of that thing, but things that cannot be produced from it are not its effects, though they too are inherently existent other. For example a rice seed can produce a rice sprout that is inherently existent other, but a barley seed cannot produce a rice sprout even though it too is inherently existent other. Similarly, a rice sprout can be produced by a rice seed that is inherently existent other, but a rice sprout cannot be produced by a barley seed even though it too is inherently existent other. Moreover, a rice sprout is produced from a rice seed that is its own previous continuum and not from a barley seed or any other seed as barley sprouts and so forth are.

In just the same way, the rice seed too is not the producer of the rice sprout, lacks the ability to produce the rice sprout, is not of the same continuum as the rice sprout and is not of a similar type to the rice sprout.

Because the actions of ascending and descending occur simultaneously, the highness and lowness of the two arms of a balance are also simultaneous. In just the same way, because the <a id="calibre_link-1443"></a>actions of the producing of what is to be produced &ndash; the sprout &ndash; and the ceasing of the producer &ndash;the seed &ndash; occur simultaneously, the two agents &ndash; the seed and the sprout &ndash; must also be simultaneous.

			<p class="text-heading">A GENERAL PRESENTATION OF THE TWO TRUTHS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Although there are infinite objects of knowledge, they are all included in <a id="calibre_link-1460"></a>two truths &ndash; ultimate truths and <a id="calibre_link-1461"></a>conventional truths. All <a id="calibre_link-1462"></a>emptinesses are ultimate truths and all phenomena other than emptinesses are conventional truths. The definition of <a id="calibre_link-1463"></a><a id="calibre_link-1464"></a>ultimate truth is the principal object of a valid cognizer that apprehends a truth. The Tibetan term for ultimate truth is <span class="italic">don dam denpa</span>, in which <span class="italic">don</span> means ‘object’, <span class="italic">dam</span> means ‘holy’ and <span class="italic">denpa</span> means ‘truth’. An ultimate truth is an object because it is the principal object of the <a id="calibre_link-1465"></a>exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of Superior beings, it is holy because it is the door to <a id="calibre_link-1466"></a>liberation and it is a truth because it exists just as it appears to a non-conceptual <a id="calibre_link-1467"></a>direct perceiver. Although all ultimate truths are the same nature, they can be divided in various ways according to their different bases. Thus there are sixteen emptinesses, four emptinesses and so forth. These are explained in more detail below.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-1468"></a><a id="calibre_link-1469"></a>conventional truth is the principal object of a valid cognizer that apprehends a false object. The Tibetan term for conventional truth is <span class="italic">kun dzob denpa</span>, in which <span class="italic">kun</span> means ‘manifold’, <span class="italic">dzob</span> means ‘false’ and <span class="italic">denpa</span> means ‘truth’. Conventional truths are manifold because, unlike emptinesses which are all the same nature, there are countless different conventional truths each with its own nature. <a id="calibre_link-1470"></a>Conventional truths are false <a id="calibre_link-1471"></a>objects because they do not exist in the way that they <a id="calibre_link-1472"></a>appear, that is they appear to be truly existent when they are not. They are called ‘truths’ because they are true for the <a id="calibre_link-1473"></a>true-grasping mind. Thus, conventional truths appear as truly existent and for the true-grasping mind this appearance is true.</p>

Their ultimate nature is the main object of a valid cognizer realizing a truth and their conventional nature is the main object of a valid cognizer realizing a false object.

			<p class="text-1st-para">As already explained, all <a id="calibre_link-1482"></a><a id="calibre_link-1483"></a>conventional truths are false objects because they <a id="calibre_link-1484"></a>appear to be truly existent when they are not. However, <a id="calibre_link-1485"></a>worldly people who have not realized emptiness do not realize this and so they distinguish between correct conventional truths and incorrect conventional truths. Thus, they would regard a face, for example, as correct or true but a reflection of a face in a mirror as incorrect, or false. In reality, however, this is a specious division because there are no correct conventional truths.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Both conventional truths that are correct with respect to the awareness of worldly people and conventional truths that are incorrect with respect to the awareness of worldly people can be divided into object-possessors and objects. The definition of an <a id="calibre_link-1486"></a>object-possessor that is correct with respect to the awareness of worldly people is a mind that is such that a person who has not realized emptiness does not realize that it is a mistaken awareness. An example is a mind apprehending a truly existent form. The definition of an <a id="calibre_link-1487"></a>object that is correct with respect to the awareness of worldly people is a phenomenon that is only an object and is such that a person who has not realized emptiness does not realize that it does not exist as it appears. An example is a visual form. The definition of an object-possessor that is incorrect with respect to the awareness of worldly people is a mind that is such that a person who has not realized emptiness realizes that it is a wrong awareness. An example is a mind to which a white snow mountain appears as yellow. The definition of an <a id="calibre_link-1488"></a>object that is incorrect with respect to the awareness of worldly people is a phenomenon that is only an object and is such that a person who has not realized emptiness realizes that it does not exist as it appears.

According to worldly people, the second type of mind is incorrect when compared with the first.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In general, there are two causes of mistaken awareness &ndash; ultimate causes and temporary causes. The ultimate causes of all mistaken awarenesses are <a id="calibre_link-1493"></a>innate true-grasping and its <a id="calibre_link-1494"></a>imprints, but worldly people do not recognize these as a source of error. They recognize only temporary, or contributory, causes of mistaken awareness. These are of two types &ndash; those that affect the <a id="calibre_link-1495"></a>sense powers and those that affect the mental power. Those that affect the sense powers are also of two types &ndash; internal causes and external causes. Examples of the first are floaters, <a id="calibre_link-1496"></a>jaundice and eating <a id="calibre_link-1497"></a>dhatura. <a id="calibre_link-1498"></a>Floaters can generate false appearances such as the appearance of hairs floating in front of the eyes, jaundice can cause us to see white objects as yellow and eating dhatura, a powerful medicinal herb, can cause things to appear golden. Examples of external causes of error that affect the sense powers are a <a id="calibre_link-1499"></a>face reflected in a mirror, spring sunlight on grey sand, a voice in an empty cave and a magician’s substance together with his spell. The first can generate a mind that sees a <a id="calibre_link-1500"></a>reflection of a face as an actual face, the second can generate a mind that sees a mirage as water, the third can generate a mind that hears an echo of a voice as an actual voice and the fourth can generate a mind that sees, for example, an illusory <a id="calibre_link-1501"></a>horse as an actual horse.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Examples of temporary causes of <a id="calibre_link-1502"></a>mistaken awareness that affect the <a id="calibre_link-1503"></a>mental power are adhering to mistaken tenets, relying on incorrect reasons and <a id="calibre_link-1504"></a>sleep. Examples of the first are adhering to the belief that <a id="calibre_link-1505"></a>Ishvara created the world and adhering to a philosophical view of a <a id="calibre_link-1506"></a>truly-existent self. Examples of the second are reasoning that there are no past and future lives because they cannot be seen and reasoning that we will always take a higher rebirth because we are human. Examples of the third are dreaming of an elephant in the room and <a id="calibre_link-1507"></a>dreaming of being someone else.

			<p class="text-heading">APPLYING THIS TO THE PRESENT SUBJECT</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.27] Just as what is observed by eyes with floaters</span></p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle"><span class="bold">Does not damage awareness without floaters,</span></p>

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last"><span class="bold">Do not damage a mind without stains.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Now the charge that the refutation of <a id="calibre_link-1521"></a>production from other is damaged by the direct perceivers of worldly people can be answered. To recapitulate, the charge is that since production from other is affirmed by the valid cognizers of worldly people and is so obvious that there is no need to state reasons to prove it, the attempt to refute production from other is futile. This argument rests on the assumption that the <a id="calibre_link-1522"></a>valid cognizers of worldly people are completely unmistaken, but this has now been shown to be not the case. In fact, all minds of <a id="calibre_link-1523"></a>worldly people including their direct valid cognizers are mistaken. Although only some of their minds are affected by temporary causes of mistaken awareness, all their minds are affected by the ultimate causes of <a id="calibre_link-1524"></a><a id="calibre_link-1525"></a>mistaken awareness <span class="bold">&ndash;</span> the ignorance of <a id="calibre_link-1526"></a>true-grasping and its <a id="calibre_link-1527"></a>imprints. Whatever <a id="calibre_link-1528"></a>appears to the minds of worldly people appears as truly existent. Therefore, worldly people apprehend only <a id="calibre_link-1529"></a>false objects; they never apprehend <a id="calibre_link-1530"></a>true objects.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">By contrast, the <a id="calibre_link-1531"></a>exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of Superior beings is an <a id="calibre_link-1532"></a>uncontaminated mind completely free from the stains of true-grasping and its imprints. Such a mind is utterly <a id="calibre_link-1533"></a>non-mistaken and whatever appears to it is true. Since the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of Superior beings sees the non-existence of production from other it follows that there is no production from other. That worldly people see things differently is of no consequence. If one person has floaters that causes him to see hairs floating in front of him we would not say that what he sees invalidates the awareness of a person with <a id="calibre_link-1534"></a>clear sight who sees no hairs in that place. In the same way the <a id="calibre_link-1535"></a>contaminated minds of <a id="calibre_link-1536"></a>worldly people distorted by true-grasping and its imprints do not invalidate the uncontaminated mind of meditative equipoise of <a id="calibre_link-1537"></a>Superior beings. The charge of damage, therefore, is reversed. Rather than the refutation of production from other being damaged by the perceptions of worldly people, it is the perceptions of worldly people that are damaged by the uncontaminated mind of Superior beings.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">But fabricated things exist only conventionally.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The Sanskrit term for <a id="calibre_link-1539"></a>conventional truth is <span class="italic">samvrtisatya</span>, in which <span class="italic">samvrti</span> means ‘obscurer’ and <span class="italic">satya</span> means ‘truth’. A conventional truth, therefore, is a truth for an obscurer. In this context the obscurer is the true-grasping mind. True-grasping is a form of ignorance that superimposes on phenomena a fabrication of <a id="calibre_link-1540"></a>true existence thereby obstructing the view of their <a id="calibre_link-1541"></a>ultimate nature, or emptiness. In <a id="calibre_link-1542"></a><span class="italic">Gone to Lanka Sutra</span> Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Conventionally <a id="calibre_link-1543"></a>things are produced,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Ultimately they have no nature.</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">That which is mistaken with respect to this lack of nature</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Is said to be conventional with respect to reality.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Everyone correctly believes that things such as cars and houses are produced in dependence on causes and conditions. These products, however, exist only conventionally and not ultimately. If they existed ultimately they would be inherently existent and if they were inherently existent they could not have been produced in dependence on causes. The true-grasping mind, however, is mistaken with respect to this lack of inherent existence. It conceives things as inherently existent and so obscures their ultimate reality. For this reason <a id="calibre_link-1544"></a>true-grasping is said to be ‘conventional with respect to reality’, that is, an obscurer of reality.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Buddha said that whatever is distorted by true-grasping in this way but appears as <a id="calibre_link-1545"></a>true to living beings is a conventional truth. However, <a id="calibre_link-1546"></a>conventional truths are true only for the true-grasping mind. For those who have abandoned true-grasping &ndash; Hinayana Foe Destroyers, Bodhisattvas on the <a id="calibre_link-1547"></a>eighth ground and above and Buddhas &ndash; they are not true objects at all but false objects. This is because these beings who are free from true-grasping directly realize them to be false. Thus, these fabricated things exist only conventionally.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Further explanation of the two truths can be found in the book <span class="italic">The </span><span class="italic"><a id="calibre_link-1548"></a></span><span class="italic">New Heart of Wisdom</span> and the ninth chapter of the book <a id="calibre_link-1549"></a><span class="italic">Meaningful to Behold</span>. It should be noted, however, that the definitions of conventional truth and ultimate truth mentioned in <span class="italic">Meaningful to Behold</span> are not actual definitions but general descriptions that reveal the meaning of the two truths according to Shantideva’s root text.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">AN EXPLANATION OF ULTIMATE TRUTH</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">That which is the actual entity is seen by clear eyes.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">You should understand thatness here in the same way.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Chandrakirti explains the nature of <a id="calibre_link-1550"></a><a id="calibre_link-1551"></a>ultimate truths with the help of an <a id="calibre_link-1552"></a>analogy. Suppose two people are looking at the space in front of them. One has floaters due to tiredness or some other cause and sees floating hairs but the other has perfectly <a id="calibre_link-1553"></a>clear sight and sees no floating hairs. What is actually there, an absence of floating hairs, is seen by the person with clear eyes because his eye sense power is free from temporary causes of <a id="calibre_link-1554"></a>mistaken awareness. In a similar way, when an ordinary being and a <a id="calibre_link-1555"></a>Buddha look at an object such as a visual form the <a id="calibre_link-1556"></a>ordinary being, whose mind is polluted by true-grasping sees a truly existent form, whereas the Buddha sees a lack of truly existent form. Again, what is actually there is seen by the Buddha because his or her mind is completely free from all causes of mistaken awareness. Thus, ultimate truth, or lack of <a id="calibre_link-1557"></a>true existence, is seen directly only by <a id="calibre_link-1558"></a>unmistaken awareness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">This analogy does not directly reveal the nature of ultimate truths but shows how they are seen by a mind free from distortion. Because ultimate truth is not like a physical object whose nature can be displayed for examination, it is helpful to try to understand it through analogies such as this. Indeed, it is said that those who teach ultimate truth, emptiness, should use appropriate analogies wherever possible.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Chandrakirti advises us that we should understand ultimate truth in the way that Buddhas see forms. When a form appears to us, if at the same time we see the lack of true existence of that form we have understood <a id="calibre_link-1559"></a>ultimate truth and the <a id="calibre_link-1560"></a>union of appearance and emptiness because at that time the appearance of form helps us to understand the lack of true existence of form. When this happens our understanding of emptiness is complete.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Therefore, on the occasion of thatness, there is no damage by the worldly.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">According to you proponents of things, our refutation of <a id="calibre_link-1561"></a>production from other is contradicted by the fact that worldly people see production from other. You say that worldly people see an inherently existent sprout produced by an inherently existent seed that is other than it. If the <a id="calibre_link-1562"></a>seed and the sprout are inherently existent they must exist in the way they appear and so they must be true. Since <a id="calibre_link-1563"></a>truth, <a id="calibre_link-1564"></a>ultimate nature, <a id="calibre_link-1565"></a>thatness and <a id="calibre_link-1566"></a>emptiness are synonyms, it follows that <a id="calibre_link-1567"></a>worldly people see thatness, or emptiness, directly with their valid cognizers. If worldly people see emptiness directly, it follows that from the beginning they are <a id="calibre_link-1568"></a>Superior beings and that they are naturally released from samsara. Therefore, what need is there for other Superior beings and what need is there to train in superior paths to attain liberation?</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">In reality, worldly people do not realize emptiness at all because they are confused with respect to ultimate truth. Although worldly people have <a id="calibre_link-1569"></a>valid cognizers they do not have valid cognizers of emptiness. Therefore, on the occasion of our explaining thatness there is no damage by the worldly and so the refutation of production from other is not damaged by worldly people.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">HOW THERE CAN BE DAMAGE BY WORLDLY PEOPLE</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.31cd] If objects of the worldly are denied</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">There is damage from the worldly by worldly renown.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">It should not be thought that worldly people are entirely confused, that they realize nothing and therefore can invalidate nothing. The conventional existence of objects such as people, cars and houses is established by the valid cognizers of worldly people. If someone were to deny the existence of such objects, their claim would be damaged by the perceptions of worldly people because such objects are established by <a id="calibre_link-1570"></a>worldly renown. However, worldly people cannot damage the refutation of production from other because production from other is not established by worldly renown.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DENYING DAMAGE BY WORLDLY PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE IS NO PRODUCTION FROM OTHER FOR THE WORLDLY, EVEN NOMINALLY</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.32] From having only sown the seeds</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">The worldly claim, ‘I produced this child’</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Or think, ‘I planted this tree’,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Therefore, there is no production from other even for the worldly.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The way worldly people speak about cause and effect shows that they have no innate idea of <a id="calibre_link-1571"></a>production from other. For example, when his wife gives birth the husband thinks that he fathered the child, and when a tree grows the gardener who originally planted the seedling thinks, ‘I planted this tree.’ Both these examples show that there is no production from other for worldly people. In the first case, for example, if the father thought that the cause, his seed, were inherently other than the effect, the child, he would not claim to have produced the child. It is the same with the gardener and his tree. Therefore, the assertion that effects arise from causes that are inherently existent other entities is damaged by the beliefs of worldly people.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The belief held by some non-Buddhists that the <a id="calibre_link-1572"></a>self is a separate entity from the aggregates is also invalidated in a similar way. If, for example, worldly people hurt their hand they say, ‘I have hurt myself’ and if their bodies are sick they say, ‘I am sick’, thus revealing that they do not think of themselves as being separate entities from their aggregates. In <a id="calibre_link-1573"></a><span class="italic">Essence of Good Explanation</span> Je Tsongkhapa says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">The mind that apprehends the self and the aggregates as different,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">And the mind that apprehends them as the same,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Are both only <a id="calibre_link-1574"></a>intellectually-formed minds.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">In the same way, the mind that apprehends production from other is only an intellectually-formed mind. It never arises in worldly people who do not propound tenets. There is no production from other for worldly people. Therefore it is quite wrong for those who hold this mistaken view to call on the perceptions of worldly people to support their belief.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITIES OF THIS REFUTATION</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.33] Because a sprout is not other than its seed</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">The seed is not destroyed at the time of the sprout,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And because they are not one</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">We do not say that the seed exists at the time of the sprout.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Having shown that the refutation of <a id="calibre_link-1575"></a>production from other is entirely free from fault, Chandrakirti now shows how it has the good qualities of avoiding the two extremes and leading to a realization of emptiness. For those who assert production from other it is impossible to avoid falling into the two <a id="calibre_link-1576"></a><a id="calibre_link-1577"></a>extremes of non-existence and existence. For example, if a seed and its sprout are inherently existent other they are completely unrelated and so the sprout is not a continuation of the seed, and so at the time of the sprout there is nothing that is the continuation of the seed. Alternatively, since the seed is inherently existent it remains as a seed forever and so the seed exists at the time of the sprout.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The refutation of production from other avoids both these extremes. Because a sprout is not inherently other than its seed, the continuum of the seed is not destroyed at the time of the sprout, and because the seed and the sprout are not inherently one, it is not necessary to say that the seed still exists at the time of the sprout. If you contemplate for a long time how a seed and its sprout are neither inherently different nor inherently the same you will come to understand how they lack inherent existence, and if you apply the same reasoning to all other objects you will eventually realize the lack of inherent existence of all phenomena. Therefore the refutation of production from other has the good qualities of avoiding the two extremes and leading us to a <a id="calibre_link-1578"></a>realization of emptiness.</p>

However, you cannot hold this position because it is an inner contradiction.

Therefore, if you assert that things are inherently produced, even nominally, you cannot refute ultimate, or truly existent, production.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">Again you reveal a failure to understand the two truths. If you understood the <a id="calibre_link-1589"></a>union of the two truths you would know that conventional truths such as <a id="calibre_link-1590"></a>cause and effect exist only because they lack <a id="calibre_link-1591"></a>inherent existence. For example, everyone will agree that a <a id="calibre_link-1592"></a>reflection of a face in a mirror is <a id="calibre_link-1593"></a>false because it does not exist as it appears. Even so, it is a <a id="calibre_link-1594"></a>functioning thing that arises in dependence on a collection of causes and conditions such as a face, a mirror and light. Moreover, a reflection generates a consciousness perceiving its aspect. Thus, reflections and so forth, which are empty of inherent existence, produce effects such as eye consciousnesses, which are also empty of inherent existence. In just the same way, although all things are empty of inherent existence nevertheless from these empty causes empty effects are generated.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">If things were inherently existent they would never produce effects because they would never change. Similarly, they would not be produced because they would not depend on anything else. Therefore those who deny lack of inherent existence cannot establish cause and effect. As Nagarjuna says in <a id="calibre_link-1595"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span>:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">For whom emptiness is impossible</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">For them everything is impossible.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Indeed everything, including <a id="calibre_link-1596"></a>samsara, <a id="calibre_link-1597"></a>nirvana and the <a id="calibre_link-1598"></a>four noble truths, would be impossible. Again Nagarjuna says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">It follows that even the four noble truths</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Are non-existent for him.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The four noble truths exist just because they lack inherent existence. Thus there is the <a id="calibre_link-1599"></a>dependent relationship of karma and delusion producing suffering, the dependent relationship of wisdom leading to liberation and so forth. If things were inherently existent, such dependent relationships would be impossible because inherently existent things do not depend on anything else. Cause and effect is a gross dependent relationship. Subtle dependent relationship is the dependence of all phenomena on imputation by conceptual thought. Both gross and subtle dependent relationships exist only because phenomena lack inherent existence.</p>

			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITY OF GREAT CONSISTENCY WITH <a id="calibre_link-1609"></a>CAUSE AND EFFECT</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This section has three parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Not asserting inherent existence does not entail acceptance of a consciousness-basis-of-all and so forth</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	Showing by analogy how an effect arises after an action has ceased</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">3	Rejecting arguments against this</p>
			<p class="text-heading">NOT ASSERTING INHERENT EXISTENCE DOES NOT ENTAIL ACCEPTANCE OF A CONSCIOUSNESS-BASIS-OF-ALL AND SO FORTH</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.39] Since it does not inherently cease</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">It has ability even though there is no basis-of-all.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Thus you should know that an appropriate effect will arise</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Even though, in some cases, a long time elapses after an action has ceased.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">For those who assert inherent existence there is the problem of how a karmic effect can arise from an action that ceased a long time ago, in some cases many aeons ago. The solution proposed by the <a id="calibre_link-1610"></a>Chittamatrins and by some <a id="calibre_link-1611"></a>Madhyamika-Svatantrikas is as follows. When an action ceases an imprint is stored at a deep level of consciousness where it remains as a <a id="calibre_link-1612"></a>potential until conditions for it to ripen are encountered. This deep level of consciousness, which is known as the ‘<a id="calibre_link-1613"></a><a id="calibre_link-1614"></a>consciousness-basis-of-all’, has three principal characteristics &ndash; (1) it is a stable mind that passes from one life to another bearing the entire store of karmic imprints accumulated during previous lives and so is the basis for the continuity of actions and their effects, (2) it is the basis for storing potentials from which various minds and their appearances arise and (3) it is the <a id="calibre_link-1615"></a>self, or person.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Those who assert a consciousness-basis-of-all say that if such a consciousness did not exist there would be no basis for preserving karmic imprints from one life to another and so there would be the fault of actions being exhausted without their effects having been experienced. They also assert a <a id="calibre_link-1616"></a>deluded mentality that is related to the consciousness-basis-of-all. This is a <a id="calibre_link-1617"></a>self-grasping mind that takes the consciousness-basis-of-all as its observed object and conceives a <a id="calibre_link-1618"></a>self-supporting, substantially existent self. Therefore according to these schools there are eight different types of consciousness &ndash; the six consciousnesses asserted by the other Buddhist schools, the consciousness-basis-of-all and the deluded mentality.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">According to the Madhyamika-Prasangika school, however, it is both unnecessary and erroneous to posit a <a id="calibre_link-1619"></a><a id="calibre_link-1620"></a>consciousness-basis-of-all. It is not the case that without a consciousness-basis-of-all actions are exhausted without their effects having been experienced. When an action ceases it does not inherently cease. Therefore the cessation of an action can produce an effect even though there is no consciousness-basis-of-all. From every action that is performed an appropriate effect will eventually arise even though in some cases a long time elapses between the original action and the maturation of its effect.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">How is it that the <a id="calibre_link-1621"></a>cessation of an action produces an effect? The cessation of an action occurs in dependence on causes. If there were nothing to cause the cessation of actions, actions would never cease and so absurdly they would be permanent. However, since actions do cease, the cessation of an action has a cause. Since whatever has a cause is a <a id="calibre_link-1622"></a>functioning thing, and whatever is a functioning thing produces its own effect, it follows that the cessation of an action is a functioning thing that produces an effect.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-1623"></a>cessation of all things occurs in dependence on causes. For example, in <a id="calibre_link-1624"></a><span class="italic">Dependent Relationship Sutra </span>Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Because of birth there is ageing and death.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">This shows that <a id="calibre_link-1625"></a>death has a cause and therefore must produce an effect. Because cessation occurs in dependence on causes it is not inherently existent. If cessation were inherently existent it would never occur. If there were no cessation there would be no past, present or future. Thus in a world of inherent existence there would be no time. However, because cessation is not inherently existent but is a functioning thing it follows that past, present and future are also functioning things.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">This presentation of the three times is unique to the Madhyamika-Prasangika school and is not easily understood by the lower schools. The Vaibhashikas, for example, believe that the three times are particular instances of one substance. They say that the substance of the sprout existing at the time of the seed is the future of the seed, the substance of the seed existing at the time of the sprout is the past of the sprout and the substance of the sprout existing at the time of the sprout is the present of the sprout. Since <a id="calibre_link-1626"></a>past, present and future are substances they are <a id="calibre_link-1627"></a>functioning things and impermanent.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Vaibhashikas assert that when a seed transforms into a sprout the aspect of the seed changes but its essential substance remains the same. Similarly, if a gold coin is melted down and made into an ornament the aspect of the gold changes but its substance remains the same. All the higher Buddhist schools find fault with this assertion. They say that it is impossible for the substance of a sprout to exist separately from the sprout. Therefore, to say that the substance of the sprout exists at the time of the seed is tantamount to saying that the sprout exists at the time of the seed.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Sautrantikas and Madhyamika-Svatantrikas say that past and future are non-affirming negatives and permanent phenomena and that present is a functioning thing and <a id="calibre_link-1628"></a>impermanent. According to the Madhyamika-Svatantrikas, the definition of past is that part of a thing that has been produced and already ceased. An example is a <a id="calibre_link-1629"></a>seed at the time of its sprout. They say that this is a non-affirming <a id="calibre_link-1630"></a>negative because all that is realized by the mind apprehending it is the non-existence of a seed that formerly existed. There are three types of past &ndash; pasts of forms, consciousnesses and non-associated compositional factors. The definition of future is that part of a thing that is to be produced but not yet produced. An example is a sprout at the time of its seed. There are three types of future &ndash; futures of forms, consciousnesses and non-associated compositional factors. All futures are also non-affirming negatives and permanent. The definition of present is that part of a thing that is produced and not yet ceased. Examples are the seed itself, or the sprout itself. There are three types of present &ndash; forms, consciousnesses and non-associated compositional factors.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definitions and divisions of the three times given by the Madhyamika-Prasangikas are the same as those given by the Madhyamika-Svatantrikas but the Madhyamika-Prasangikas explain them in quite a different way. They do not accept that past and future are non-affirming negatives but assert all three times to be <a id="calibre_link-1631"></a>functioning things. To understand this we need to contemplate carefully the following reasoning.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">If someone were to ask, for example, ‘Is the <a id="calibre_link-1632"></a>Emanation Body of <a id="calibre_link-1633"></a>Buddha Shakyamuni past, present, or future?’ most of us would reply that it is past. We would say this because it is past with respect to us, but why should we regard our position in time as more valid than anyone else’s? For example, from the point of view of those alive at the time of Buddha Shakyamuni his Emanation Body is a present and from the point of view of those alive at the time of <a id="calibre_link-1634"></a>Buddha Kashyapa it is a future. Thus, if we judge time from the point of view of the observer we have to say that Buddha’s Emanation Body is a past, a present and a future! This problem arises only because we judge time from the point of view of ourself rather than from the point of view of the object.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">According to the Madhyamika-Prasangikas there are no past things and no future things; all functioning things are necessarily present. However, there are pasts <span class="italic">of</span> things and futures <span class="italic">of</span> things, and these are functioning things because they are produced from causes and produce effects. A seed, for example, is a present but it has a past and a future. The past of the seed is the cessation of the seed. Even though this cessation is a past at the time of the seed it is a future and when the seed is destroyed it is a present. Thus, the past of a seed is a functioning thing that exists after that seed has ceased. Similarly, the future of a seed is a functioning thing that exists before that seed exists. Before the seed exists the future of the seed is a present but at the time of the seed it is a past.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Altogether there are eight profound points unique to the <a id="calibre_link-1635"></a>Madhyamika-Prasangika school that are not easily understood by the lower schools. They are:</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">We can understand how an <a id="calibre_link-1638"></a>action that has <a id="calibre_link-1639"></a>ceased produces an effect by considering the following <a id="calibre_link-1640"></a><a id="calibre_link-1641"></a>analogy. Suppose a foolish man with strong attachment sees a beautiful woman in his dreams and when he awakes continues to generate attachment for her. Even though the dream woman lacked inherent existence and even though she has ceased by the time he awakes, nevertheless she still produces an effect by generating attachment in his mind. Likewise, even though an action lacks inherent existence and even though there is no <a id="calibre_link-1642"></a>consciousness-basis-of-all the action still produces an effect after it has ceased.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">REJECTING ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Objection</span> You say that when an action ceases it does not inherently cease, but if actions did not inherently cease the process of an action producing an effect would never stop and so the ripening of effects would be endless.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.41] Although the objects are similar in not existing,</span></p>

Some, such as <a id="calibre_link-1645"></a>floaters, cause the appearance of floating hairs, whereas others, such as pressure on the eyeball, cause the appearance of two moons, etc. However, even though these spurious objects are all similar in not existing, a person with floaters sees the appearance of floating hairs but not the appearance of other things such as two moons. This helps us to understand how an action that has already ripened cannot ripen again. Thus, even though both <a id="calibre_link-1646"></a>virtuous and <a id="calibre_link-1647"></a>non-virtuous actions are similar in not inherently ceasing, nevertheless unpleasant effects arise from non-virtuous actions and pleasant effects arise from virtuous actions. Since the effects of actions are definite, the process of their effects ripening cannot be endless. Those who realize that virtuous and non-virtuous actions do not exist inherently will quickly eradicate self-grasping and thereby attain liberation from samsara.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The subtle relationships between particular <a id="calibre_link-1648"></a>actions and their effects are very difficult to realize. In the Sutras, Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">The fully-ripened effects of actions are inconceivable.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">If ordinary beings try to understand the subtle relationships of actions and their effects through detailed analysis there is a great danger of their developing wrong views and rejecting karma entirely. Therefore Buddha advised us against over-analysis of actions and their effects, encouraging us instead to rely on the scriptures for our understanding of such points.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">It is true that Buddha taught that consciousness-basis-of-all exists. He also taught that a substantially existent person exists and that the aggregates alone truly exist. However, all these teachings require <a id="calibre_link-1651"></a>interpretation because they were given not according to Buddha’s final intention but according to the capacities and inclinations of disciples who do not understand the very profound meaning of emptiness just explained.</p>

Since Buddha often taught according to the inclinations of his disciples, not all his words have a definitive meaning. For example, even though he is free from the <a id="calibre_link-1653"></a>view of the transitory collection and its imprints and has abandoned all conceptions grasping at I and mine, nevertheless Buddha reveals these through his use of expressions like ‘I’ and ‘mine’. In the same way, even though things are not inherently existent Buddha reveals inherent existence as a teaching of interpretative meaning. Therefore the refutation of consciousness-basis-of-all and the refutation of inherent existence do not contradict these scriptures.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">As mentioned before, all the Buddhist schools below the Madhyamika-Prasangikas assert production from other, and their assertions are generally refuted by the refutation presented above. However Chandrakirti uses the occasion of the refutation of production from other to provide an extensive refutation of the <a id="calibre_link-1659"></a>Chittamatra system in particular. This refutation, which takes the form of a debate between the Chittamatrins and the Madhyamika-Prasangikas, is presented in three parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Refuting an inherently existent consciousness without externals</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	Refuting the validity of the reason establishing other-powered phenomena as inherently existent</p>

			<p class="text-heading">STATING THE OTHER SYSTEM</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The following verses summarize the main points of the <a id="calibre_link-1660"></a>Chittamatra position:</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Chittamatrins</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.45] </span><span class="bold-italic">‘An apprehender is not seen without an apprehended.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold-italic">By realizing the three realms as mere consciousness</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold-italic">The Bodhisattva abiding in wisdom</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold-italic">Realizes thatness in mere consciousness.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.46]</span><span class="bold-italic"> Just as waves arise from a great ocean</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold-italic">When it is stirred by the wind,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold-italic">Likewise, because of its potentials a mere consciousness arises</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold-italic">From the seed of all, which is called ‘basis-of-all’.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.47]</span><span class="bold-italic"> Therefore whatever is an other-powered entity</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold-italic">Is the cause of imputedly existent things.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold-italic">It arises without external objects, exists,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold-italic">And has the nature of not being an object of any elaboration.’</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">No <a id="calibre_link-1661"></a>object exists without being apprehended by a subjective <a id="calibre_link-1662"></a>mind, and a subjective mind cannot exist without an apprehended object. Objects are empty of being separate entities from their minds and minds are empty of being separate entities from their objects. This <a id="calibre_link-1663"></a>emptiness, which is called the ‘<a id="calibre_link-1664"></a>non-duality of apprehended and apprehender’, is the profound emptiness that is the door to liberation. A more subtle emptiness does not exist. A Bodhisattva on the sixth ground realizes that all phenomena of the three realms are merely the <a id="calibre_link-1665"></a>nature of consciousness and in this way realizes the thatness of non-duality and experiences all the good qualities of the surpassing <a id="calibre_link-1666"></a>perfection of wisdom.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">All things such as forms and the minds that apprehend them arise from the ripening of their <a id="calibre_link-1667"></a>potentials on the <a id="calibre_link-1668"></a>consciousness-basis-of-all. Therefore forms do not exist externally to the mind. For example, when we see a blue object a potential for a mind to which blue appears is placed on the consciousness-basis-of-all. When this potential subsequently ripens a mere consciousness to which blue appears arises. Both the mind and its aspect, blue, are generated simultaneously from the same potential. Since blue arises entirely from a potential on the consciousness-basis-of-all it is not an external object but is the same nature as the mind that apprehends it. Just as waves that arise from a great ocean when it is stirred by the wind are not a separate substance from the ocean, so forms that arise from potentials on the consciousness-basis-of-all are not a separate substance from the mind. Everything is the nature of mind; nothing exists externally to the mind.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Even though there are no <a id="calibre_link-1669"></a>external objects all other-powered phenomena are truly existent entities. An <a id="calibre_link-1670"></a>other-powered phenomenon is anything that is generated from causes and conditions. Other-powered phenomenon and <a id="calibre_link-1671"></a>functioning thing are synonyms. An eye <a id="calibre_link-1672"></a>consciousness apprehending blue is an example of a truly existent <a id="calibre_link-1673"></a>other-powered phenomenon. It is an other-powered phenomenon because it arises in dependence on causes and conditions that are other than it. It is truly existent for three reasons:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	It arises from its own cause, a potential on the consciousness-basis-of-all, without there being any external objects.</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(2)	In dependence on this eye consciousness, a conceptual mind is generated that conceives the eye consciousness and its object, blue, to be different entities. This is a <a id="calibre_link-1674"></a>self-grasping mind and a wrong awareness. Its conceived object &ndash; subject and object being different entities &ndash; is a fictitious entity merely imputed by the mind.</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-last">(3)	It is not the direct object of speech or conception and therefore has the nature of not being the object of any elaboration.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">All things such as visual <a id="calibre_link-1675"></a>forms, sounds, smells, tastes and tactile objects arise from potentials on the consciousness-basis-of-all and so they are all the same nature as the mind that apprehends them and they are all truly existent.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Madhyamika-Prasangikas</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.48] Where is there an example of a mind without an </span><span class="bold"><a id="calibre_link-1676"></a></span><span class="bold">external object?</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">If you say it is like a dream then let us consider that.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">For us, mind does not exist even when dreaming;</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Therefore you do not have an example.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.49] If mind exists because we remember the dream when awake,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Then it is the same with external objects.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Just as according to you we remember, thinking, ‘I saw’,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">So, like that, external objects also exist.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Do you Chittamatrins have an example of a <a id="calibre_link-1677"></a>truly existent <a id="calibre_link-1678"></a>mind without external objects?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Chittamatrins</span> Yes, we have a perfect example. Suppose you fall asleep in a small room and <a id="calibre_link-1679"></a>dream of an elephant. Clearly the object of the <a id="calibre_link-1680"></a>dream, an elephant in the room, does not exist and yet there is a truly existent mind to which it appears. In a similar way, even though <a id="calibre_link-1681"></a>external objects do not exist there are truly existent minds to which they appear.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Madhyamika-Prasangikas</span> Let us consider this example. You say that the object of the dream does not exist and yet the dream mind truly exists. According to our system however neither the elephant nor the mind truly exists at any time, either when dreaming or when awake. Therefore you do not have a correct example.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Chittamatrins</span> The dream mind must truly exist because we can remember the experience of the dream when awake.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Madhyamika-Prasangikas</span> Then it is just the same with external objects. For example, according to you the dream mind truly exists because we remember it by thinking, ‘I saw an elephant.’ In that case the object of the dream, the elephant, also truly exists because we remember that as well. Thus if a mind truly exists its object also truly exists. Since according to you the mind to which <a id="calibre_link-1682"></a>external objects appear truly exists, it follows that the external objects that appear to that mind also truly exist. On the other hand, if you want to say that external objects do not truly exist you will also have to say that mind does not truly exist either. Therefore you are wrong to assert that there is a truly existent mind without external objects.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE EXAMPLE OF A <a id="calibre_link-1683"></a>DREAM DOES NOT PROVE THAT THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL OBJECTS WHEN AWAKE</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.50] </span><span class="bold-italic">‘Because eye awareness is impossible in </span><span class="bold-italic"><a id="calibre_link-1684"></a></span><span class="bold-italic">sleep, it does not exist,</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold-italic">As it is in dreams, so it is here.’</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">When we are asleep the <a id="calibre_link-1685"></a>sense awarenesses do not function; only the <a id="calibre_link-1686"></a>mental awareness functions. Therefore an object of eye awareness does not exist at that time; all dream appearances are mere appearances to the mental awareness. For example, dream blue is a mere aspect that appears directly to the mental awareness. Dreamers, however, conceive that blue to be an external object. Even though dreamers conceive there to be external objects, in reality there are no external objects in a dream. It is exactly the same when we are awake. Even though ordinary beings conceive there to be external objects, in reality there are no external objects.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Madhyamika-Prasangikas</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.51] If you say this, then just as for you external objects are not produced in dreams,</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">[VI.52a] And those three of the remainder, ears and so forth, are also not produced.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">You say that external objects are not inherently produced in dreams. Well, the same is true of the mental awareness &ndash; it too is not inherently produced in dreams. The eye sense power of the dream, the visual object of the dream and the <a id="calibre_link-1687"></a><a id="calibre_link-1688"></a>dream mind that they generate are all false objects because they do not appear in the way that they exist. It is the same with the other <a id="calibre_link-1689"></a>dream <a id="calibre_link-1690"></a>sense powers, dream sense objects and dream sense awarenesses. For example, dream ears, dream sounds and the dream mind that they generate are also not inherently produced. Thus, the example of the dream does not prove that there are no external objects when awake &ndash; it proves that there is no inherently existent mind when asleep.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE EXAMPLE OF A DREAM PROVES THAT ALL THINGS ARE FALSE</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Madhyamika-Prasangikas</span></p>

Thus, whether awake or asleep minds do not inherently exist, objects enjoyed by the senses do not inherently exist, and the sense powers do not inherently exist.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-1694"></a>Dream minds, objects and sense powers exist with respect to the dreaming mind during <a id="calibre_link-1695"></a>sleep in much the same way as waking minds, objects and sense powers exist with respect to the waking mind when awake. When we wake from sleep the minds, objects and sense powers of the dream cease to exist with respect to the waking mind. In the same way, when we wake from the <a id="calibre_link-1696"></a>sleep of confusion the minds, objects and sense powers of the waking state cease to exist with respect to the <a id="calibre_link-1697"></a>exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of a Superior being. This shows that all things that exist, both when dreaming and when awake, are false. Therefore you should not say that consciousness is truly existent but external objects are not.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">As mentioned before, when a Superior being is in meditative equipoise all <a id="calibre_link-1698"></a>dualistic appearance subsides into emptiness. With respect to that wisdom <a id="calibre_link-1699"></a>conventional phenomena such as minds, <a id="calibre_link-1700"></a>sense objects and sense powers do not exist. If they were <a id="calibre_link-1701"></a>truly existent they would definitely appear to that mind because whatever is <a id="calibre_link-1702"></a>true must appear to an exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of a Superior being. Therefore, minds, <a id="calibre_link-1703"></a>sense objects and <a id="calibre_link-1704"></a>sense powers are all false objects because they do not appear to the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of a Superior being. In fact all the conventional phenomena of the base, the path and the result are false objects. As Venerable <a id="calibre_link-1705"></a>Milarepa says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">From the point of view of ultimate truth,</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Chittamatrins</span> There is another example of a <a id="calibre_link-1708"></a>truly existent consciousness without external objects. When a person with floaters develops an eye consciousness seeing hairs floating in front of his eyes, a truly existent mind is generated within his continuum, but its object, <a id="calibre_link-1709"></a>floating hairs, does not exist at all.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Madhyamika-Prasangikas</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.54] A mind of </span><span class="bold"><a id="calibre_link-1710"></a></span><span class="bold">sense powers affected by floaters</span></p>

When a person with clear sight looks at that place neither floating hairs nor a mind to which floating hairs appears arises for him. Therefore, the mind with floaters and the floating hairs that appear to it are either both truly existent or both false. It is not appropriate to say that one is truly existent while the other is false.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">You Chittamatrins say that although there is no object of knowledge, floating hairs, nevertheless the mind to which they appear truly exists. If this is the case then if a person with clear sight looks at the place where the hairs are seen, he too will generate a mind seeing floating hairs. This is because a mind seeing floating hairs is inherently produced and does not depend on anything else to generate it.

			<p class="text-1st-para">Even though there are no <a id="calibre_link-1722"></a>external objects, nevertheless the five sense consciousnesses, the five <a id="calibre_link-1723"></a>sense powers and the five objects of the <a id="calibre_link-1724"></a>senses exist. For example, an eye <a id="calibre_link-1725"></a>consciousness apprehending blue is produced entirely from its potential, an imprint of a previous eye consciousness apprehending blue. That imprint was placed on the <a id="calibre_link-1726"></a>consciousness-basis-of-all immediately the previous eye consciousness apprehending blue ceased. A potential that acts as the basis for an eye consciousness apprehending blue is an eye <a id="calibre_link-1727"></a>sense power possessing form and is the dominant condition of that eye consciousness. The remaining four sense powers can be understood in the same way.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Just as sense powers exist without there being any external objects, so do sense objects such as colours, sounds and smells. For example, when an eye consciousness apprehending blue arises from its sense power, a potential on the consciousness-basis-of-all, its object, the <a id="calibre_link-1728"></a>appearance of blue, also arises from that same potential. Thus, what we call colours, sounds, smells and so forth are only appearances to the mind that arise from imprints on the consciousness-basis-of-all; they do not exist outside the mind. Not realizing this, ordinary beings think that they are <a id="calibre_link-1729"></a>external objects.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">To understand how <a id="calibre_link-1730"></a>forms such as blue exist we should consider what happens when we <a id="calibre_link-1731"></a>dream, say, of an elephant. The elephant in our <a id="calibre_link-1732"></a>dream is not outside the mind because there is no elephant in the room, it is not the mind itself because it is not an awareness and it is not separate from the mind because if the mind apprehending the elephant ceases the elephant disappears. The elephant is just an appearance to mind that is otherwise indescribable. In the same way, forms such as blue are not outside the mind, are not the mind itself and are not separate from the mind, they are mere appearances to mind that are otherwise indescribable.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">It is essential to realize that all forms are merely the <a id="calibre_link-1733"></a>nature of mind. When we see a car, for example, we should realize that it is merely an appearance to the consciousness-basis-of-all &ndash; it does not exist outside the mind. External objects are the subtle object of negation of emptiness and the mind that conceives them is self-grasping of phenomena and the source of all delusions. An object’s lack of being a separate entity from the mind is ultimate emptiness, the subtle <a id="calibre_link-1734"></a><a id="calibre_link-1735"></a>selflessness of phenomena, and the mind that directly realizes this is the wisdom that destroys all delusions and leads to <a id="calibre_link-1736"></a>liberation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Even though external objects do not exist, nevertheless we generate inherently existent <a id="calibre_link-1737"></a>minds to which they appear.

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	it is the basis for conveying karmic potentialities from one life to another</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(2)	since there are no external objects it is the basis for storing potentials from which the various minds and their appearances arise</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-last">(3)	it is the very continuity of a person from one life to another and so it is the <a id="calibre_link-1763"></a>self. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">These <a id="calibre_link-1764"></a>reasons are refuted by the Madhyamika-Prasangikas as follows:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	The Chittamatrins have invented a <a id="calibre_link-1765"></a>consciousness-basis-of-all that is a repository of karmic potentials awaiting the conditions to ripen because they do not understand how an <a id="calibre_link-1766"></a>action that has <a id="calibre_link-1767"></a>ceased produces an effect. In reality karmic <a id="calibre_link-1768"></a>potentials are borne from one life to another by the mere I and there is no need to posit a consciousness-basis-of-all to explain this.</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(2)	Since external objects exist, a consciousness such as an eye consciousness is generated by an object meeting a sense power, and not from potentials stored on the consciousness-basis-of-all. There is no need to posit a consciousness-basis-of-all to explain how consciousness arises.

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Chittamatrins</span> In the Sutras it explains how Yogis meditate on unattractiveness to overcome attachment to such things as places and bodies. In one such meditation they generate a concentration to which there appears clearly the <a id="calibre_link-1787"></a><a id="calibre_link-1788"></a>ground covered with skeletons. This mind is inherently existent but its object is not. When you say there are no inherently existent minds but there are external objects you contradict the experience of these Yogis.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">On the contrary, it is you who have contradictions in your position for your view contradicts both scripture and reason. It is true that some Yogis by relying on the instructions of their Spiritual Guide develop a concentration whereby they see clearly the ground covered with skeletons, but they also see that the mind, the object and the sense power are not inherently produced because in the Sutras Buddha explains that, being a conventional truth, this <a id="calibre_link-1789"></a>mind is <a id="calibre_link-1790"></a>false. According to you, however, it is a true mind and if the <a id="calibre_link-1791"></a>mind is true its object must also be true. So clearly you are in contradiction with the Sutras.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Your position also contradicts reason because according to you the objects of the mind of unattractiveness are just like the objects of sense consciousness. Take for example a situation where a number of people are watching a display of dancing. One person looking in the direction of the display sees the dancers with his eye consciousness and others who look in the same direction see them too. In the same way, when a Yogi in meditation sees the ground covered with skeletons, if someone else who is not familiar with this meditation directs their mind to the same place they will also see the ground covered with skeletons. This is because according to you the mind that sees the ground covered with skeletons is inherently existent and does not depend on meditation for its production. If it can be produced for a Yogi without depending on meditation, it can also be produced for the non-meditator in the same way. In reality, of course, this is not the case. The concentration to which there appears the ground covered with skeletons is not inherently existent nor is it a wrong awareness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Furthermore, you cannot say that a mind generated from a sense power affected by <a id="calibre_link-1792"></a>floaters, a mind seeing an illusion, a mind seeing a reflection or a hungry ghost’s mind seeing a river as pus and blood are examples of inherently existent minds without external objects. We have already explained the faults in the first and these faults also apply to all these other examples.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">When a <a id="calibre_link-1793"></a>hungry ghost looks at flowing water he sees only pus and blood. At that time pus and blood newly arise in that place as the environmental effect of the hungry ghost’s karma. Pus and blood appear to the hungry ghost and pus and blood actually exist. Since the mind of a hungry ghost that sees pus and blood is not deceptive it is a <a id="calibre_link-1794"></a>valid cognizer. If a god, a <a id="calibre_link-1795"></a>human and a hungry ghost were to look at a glass containing a moist, liquid substance the god would see nectar, the human water and the hungry ghost pus and blood. For the <a id="calibre_link-1796"></a>god, nectar newly arises as the environmental effect of his karma and he sees the nectar directly with a valid cognizer. Similarly, for the human, water newly arises as the environmental effect of his <a id="calibre_link-1797"></a>karma and he sees the water directly with a valid cognizer, and for the hungry ghost pus and blood newly arise as the environmental effect of his karma and he sees the pus and blood directly with a valid cognizer. There are not, however, three different liquids on the same base. For example, if three people &ndash; one a friend, one an enemy and one a complete stranger &ndash; look at a person called Peter, the first will see an attractive person, the second an unattractive person and the third a person who is neither attractive nor unattractive, but there are not three different Peters.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Chittamatrins</span> The existence of <a id="calibre_link-1805"></a>memory proves the existence of self-cognizers. For example, if we see a blue object we can subsequently remember not only the blue but also our having seen blue. In other words, we remember both the object and the mind that cognized the object. Since we cannot remember something we have not previously experienced we must have experienced the mind seeing blue when it arose. If the eye consciousness seeing blue was experienced there are only two possibilities &ndash; either it was experienced by another consciousness or it was experienced by itself. If it were experienced by another consciousness that consciousness in turn would have to have been experienced by another consciousness and so on ad infinitum. Since this is clearly absurd the eye consciousness cannot have been experienced by another consciousness. Therefore it must have been experienced by itself. A mind that knows itself without depending on an object is a self-cognizer. Therefore the existence of memory proves the existence of self-cognizers.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Such distinctions are also destroyed by this reasoning.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">When you say that the existence of self-cognizers is proven by memory generated later, are you referring to inherently existent memory or mere memory? If you are saying that inherently existent memory proves the existence of self-cognizers you are asserting an unproven entity, inherently existent memory, as a proof and something that is unproven does not prove anything. If you are saying that mere memory proves the existence of self-cognizers, this is also unsuitable because whereas mere memory exists, self-cognizers do not.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Even if self-cognizers are admitted, as they are in your system, it is impossible for memory to remember anything because, according to you, the mind that originally experiences the object and the mind that subsequently remembers it are inherently existent other and thus completely unrelated. It is not possible for a mind to remember the experiences of another completely unrelated mind. It would be as if the memory were generated in a completely different continuum. For example, if Peter experiences the taste of an apple, Paul cannot subsequently remember that experience because Paul’s mind is different from and completely unrelated to Peter’s mind. You cannot say that two completely unrelated minds are in the same <a id="calibre_link-1807"></a>continuum, nor can you say that an experiencing consciousness, although inherently existent other, is nevertheless the cause of a subsequent remembering consciousness, because if the two minds are inherently existent other they must be unrelated and so cannot be <a id="calibre_link-1808"></a>cause and effect. All distinctions such as unrelated minds being in the same continuum and inherently existent cause and effect are destroyed by this reasoning.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Madhyamika-Prasangikas</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.75] Because for us this memory is not other than</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">This is also the way of worldly convention.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Because for us memory is not inherently existent other than the consciousness that originally experienced the object, we can say that both the original mind and the remembering mind are in the same <a id="calibre_link-1809"></a>continuum and that both minds have the same object. Therefore, even though there are no self-cognizers a memory that thinks, ‘I saw blue’ can develop. When we remember blue, for example, we remember both, ‘I saw <span class="italic">blue</span>’ and ‘I <span class="italic">saw</span> blue.’ In other words we remember both the object, the blue itself, and the subject, the eye consciousness. Even though the eye consciousness is not the I it is perfectly natural to remember it by thinking, ‘I saw blue.’ For example, even though I am not my hand if my hand is in pain it is perfectly natural for me to say, ‘I am in pain.’ The remembering consciousness remembers the previous subject through the force of remembering the object not because the previous subject was experienced by a self-cognizer. This is also the way it is understood by worldly people. Because you assert self-cognizers you cannot establish the existence of memory whereas we can give a perfectly adequate account of memory without the need to posit self-cognizers.</p>

Since this is absurd, it follows that an eye consciousness cannot apprehend itself. So how are we to understand your assertion of an inherently existent consciousness that is an other-powered phenomenon? If such a consciousness exists it must be apprehended either by a valid cognizer that is other than itself or by a valid cognizer that is identical with itself. You have already dismissed the first possibility and we have disproved the second by showing that there are no self-cognizers. Therefore, by what valid cognizer is your other-powered phenomenon apprehended? Clearly there is none and since whatever is not apprehended by a valid cognizer is <a id="calibre_link-1810"></a>non-existent it follows that an inherently existent consciousness does not exist.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">That mind arises from ignorance and karma?</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">When the compassionate, skilful Buddha said that the <a id="calibre_link-1852"></a>three realms are only mind, his intention was to show that mind has primacy over forms. For example, Buddha sometimes used the term ‘increase of thatness’ to mean ‘<a id="calibre_link-1853"></a>Buddha’. The Tibetan word for Buddha is <a id="calibre_link-1854"></a><span class="italic">sang gyay</span>. According to one etymology, <span class="italic">sang</span> means ‘awakened from the sleep of delusion’, and <span class="italic">gyay</span> means ‘increase of the wisdom of thatness, or emptiness’. Thus a Buddha is someone who has awakened from the sleep of delusion and perfectly increased the wisdom of emptiness. Even though Sutra says only ‘increase of thatness’ and does not mention ‘awakened from the sleep of delusion’, nevertheless the latter is understood and the phrase is taken to mean ‘Buddha’. Similarly, in <a id="calibre_link-1855"></a><span class="italic">Sutra on the Ten Grounds</span> the phrase ‘only mind’ is used for ‘only mind is principal.’ Although ‘is principal’ is not mentioned it is understood and the phrase should be taken to mean ‘only mind is principal in the world.’ In other words, the meaning is that within the three realms mind and not form is the principal agent. This Sutra does not deny external forms.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">If, as you believe, Buddha knew that these three realms are only the nature of inherently existent mind and if he denied external forms in <a id="calibre_link-1856"></a><span class="italic">Sutra on the Ten Grounds</span>, why did he say again in the same Sutra when he was explaining the <a id="calibre_link-1857"></a>twelve dependent-related links that dependent-related consciousness arises from dependent-related ignorance and dependent-related compositional actions?

Since all actions are accumulated by mind it follows that all worlds and their inhabitants are created by mind. Even bodily and verbal actions originate in the mind. If there is no mind there are no actions. Thus a person can accumulate actions but a picture of a person cannot. Although we often say, ‘I created this’, or, ‘He created that’, the real creator is our mind. Since the mental predominates over the physical some texts say that the mind is like a master and the <a id="calibre_link-1863"></a>body like its slave.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">You may say that the world developed from the amassing of many atomic particles. This is true, but what caused these particles to assemble?

The amassing of atomic particles was only the secondary cause of this world, the main cause was the collective karma of the living beings who inhabit it.

			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">All phenomena without exception are created by mind because all phenomena are <a id="calibre_link-1864"></a>imputed by conceptual mind.

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Since <a id="calibre_link-1867"></a>living beings’ minds are impure the world they inhabit is impure, but when their minds become pure their world becomes pure.

So that we may understand this, <a id="calibre_link-1868"></a><span class="italic">Sutra on the Ten Grounds</span> rejects a creator other than mind.

Thus, all five <a id="calibre_link-1872"></a>aggregates, that is all internal minds and all external forms, exist because they are known by worldly renown. However, when a Superior being experiences the <a id="calibre_link-1873"></a>exalted awareness of meditative equipoise realizing thatness, none of these five arise for him or her. This is because once his mind has absorbed in single-pointed concentration on thatness all dualistic appearance subsides into emptiness and conventional phenomena such as the mind and external forms cease to appear to him. This shows that both internal mind and external forms lack inherent existence and do not exist ultimately. Therefore, if you want to assert that external objects do not exist do not hold to the existence of mind, and if you want to assert that mind exists do not hold to the non-existence of external objects.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">This is also established by scripture as well as by reasoning.

			<p class="text-1st-para">This scripture makes it clear that <span class="italic">Gone to Lanka Sutra</span> and other Sutras of this kind such as <a id="calibre_link-1889"></a><span class="italic">Interpreting the Intention Sutra</span> are of interpretative meaning. For example, when a doctor administers medicine he treats each patient differently according to their needs; he does not give them all the same medicine. If a patient is in great pain the doctor will first administer a pain killer to reduce the pain and then he will begin to treat the disease that is causing it. In the same way, when Buddha teaches Dharma he administers Dharma medicine for the mind according to the needs of individual disciples; he does not give everyone the same instructions. If a disciple is suffering greatly from the pain of <a id="calibre_link-1890"></a>attachment to forms Buddha first administers the Chittamatrin view that there are no external <a id="calibre_link-1891"></a>forms. This has the effect of temporarily reducing his or her problem of attachment, but to remove its root, <a id="calibre_link-1892"></a>self-grasping, the disciple must apply another remedy &ndash; the Madhyamika-Prasangika view. This shows clearly that teachings on ‘only mind’ are of interpretative, not definitive, meaning.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">In his <a id="calibre_link-1893"></a><span class="italic">Autocommentary</span> to the <span class="italic">Guide</span>, Chandrakirti mentions four Sutras that are of interpretative meaning &ndash; the Sutra revealing the non-existence of external objects, the Sutra revealing <a id="calibre_link-1894"></a>consciousness-basis-of-all, the Sutra differentiating the three natures as truly existent or not truly existent and the Sutra revealing three <a id="calibre_link-1895"></a>final vehicles. Although the Chittamatrins believe that these are all Sutras of definitive meaning, Chandrakirti proves with the aid of <span class="italic">Gone to Lanka Sutra</span> and with powerful reasoning that they are all of interpretative meaning. An extensive account of this is given by Je Tsongkhapa in <a id="calibre_link-1896"></a><span class="italic">Essence of Good Explanation Revealing Interpretative and Definitive Meaning</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">SHOWING BY MEANS OF REASONING THAT IT IS OF INTERPRETATIVE MEANING</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.96] The Buddhas have said that if objects of mind do not exist,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">The absence of mind is easily realized.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Since if objects of mind do not exist the refutation of mind is established,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Objects of mind are refuted first.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The Buddhas have said that once we have realized that external forms do not exist inherently we will easily realize that internal mind also does not exist inherently. Therefore, Buddha first refutes inherently existent <a id="calibre_link-1897"></a>external objects of mind and then refutes inherently existent mind. Thus Buddha’s statement that there are no external objects must be interpreted to mean that there are no inherently existent external objects. Since Buddha’s words in this case do not explicitly reveal his actual intention but require interpretation we say that this Sutra is of interpretative meaning.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">A METHOD FOR RECOGNIZING SUTRAS OF INTERPRETATIVE AND DEFINITIVE MEANING</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.97] Thus, having understood this explanation of the scriptures,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">You should realize that any Sutra whose meaning does not explain thatness</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Is taught as interpretative, and you should interpret it.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">You should know that those whose meaning is emptiness are of definitive meaning.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Having understood this explanation of interpretative and <a id="calibre_link-1898"></a>definitive meaning in the scriptures you should know how to distinguish the two types of Sutra. The definition of Sutra of interpretative meaning is a Sutra whose main meaning is not emptiness and that principally and explicitly teaches conventional truths. Examples are <a id="calibre_link-1899"></a><span class="italic">Interpreting the Intention Sutra</span> and the four Sutras mentioned above. The definition of Sutra of definitive meaning is a Sutra that principally and explicitly reveals emptiness. Examples are the <a id="calibre_link-1900"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span>. This method for recognizing the two types of Sutra is based on <a id="calibre_link-1901"></a><span class="italic">King of Concentration Sutra </span>where it says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">As the Sugatas taught emptiness,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Know these Sutras to be of definitive meaning.</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Where <a id="calibre_link-1902"></a>sentient beings, persons and beings are taught,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Know these Dharmas to be all of interpretative meaning.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This verse teaches that Sutras that principally and explicitly reveal the lack of inherent existence of persons and phenomena are of definitive meaning, and Sutras that principally and explicitly reveal conventional phenomena such as <a id="calibre_link-1903"></a>sentient beings and so forth are of interpretative meaning. This way of distinguishing the two types of Sutra accords with the tenets of the Madhyamika-Prasangika school. The assertions of the lower schools are different. The <a id="calibre_link-1904"></a>Vaibhashikas do not even believe in the existence of Sutras of interpretative meaning.</p>

			<p id="calibre_link-1908" class="chapter-title-toc-level"><a id="calibre_link-28"></a>The Meaning of this Refutation</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Having refuted production from self and production from other, Chandrakirti now briefly refutes the two remaining positions &ndash; production from both self and other and production without a cause.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">REFUTING PRODUCTION FROM BOTH</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><a id="calibre_link-1909"></a>Production from both self and other is asserted by the non- Buddhist Jains. It will be helpful to begin by considering their argument.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Jains</span> All external and internal things are produced from both self and other. For example, because a clay pot is the same nature as the clay from which it is made it is produced from self, but because it is a different nature from the potter who made it, it is also produced from other. The same is true of all other external things. Similarly, internal things such as people are also produced from both self and other. A woman, for example, is produced from the self of her last life and in that respect she is produced from self, but she is also produced in dependence on her parents of this life who are other than herself, and in this respect she is produced from other.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Madhyamika-Prasangikas</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.98] Production from both is also not a suitable entity.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Why? Because all the faults already explained apply.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">It does not exist for the worldly nor is it asserted in thatness</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Because production from either is not established.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Since neither production from self nor production from other is possible, it is also not suitable to assert production from both self and other. Why? Because all the faults of production from self and production from other that have already been explained apply to production from both. Furthermore, production from both self and other does not exist either nominally or ultimately because production from either self or other is not established in the two truths. Therefore production from both should not be asserted at all.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">REFUTING PRODUCTION WITHOUT A CAUSE</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><a id="calibre_link-1910"></a>Production without a cause is asserted by the non-Buddhist <a id="calibre_link-1911"></a>Charavakas.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Charavakas</span> We do not assert either production from self or production from other; rather we believe that all things are produced entirely without causes. If you look at external things such as flowers you will see that they have various shapes, colours, scents and so forth, but no one made these, they simply developed naturally. Thorns, for example, are sharp and peas are round but no one made them like this; it is simply the nature of a thorn to be sharp and of a pea to be round. It is the same with internal things such as the eye of a peacock’s feather or the colours of a butterfly’s wing &ndash; all these things simply arise naturally without causes.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Madhyamika-Prasangikas</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.99] If there is production entirely without causes</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Then everything is produced from everything all the time,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And so to obtain fruit the people of this world</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Do not have to gather seeds and so forth in a hundred ways.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.100] If living beings are empty of causes, they are unapprehendable</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Like the fragrance and colour of an upala flower in the sky,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">But a very colourful world is apprehended.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Therefore you should know that, like your mind, the world comes from causes.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">If, as you say, things are produced entirely without causes then everything is produced from everything. Butter is produced from water, oil from sand, water from fire and children from men because none of these things requires its own cause to be produced. Furthermore, because things do not require causes, everything is produced all the time. The beautiful flowers that grow on the mountains in the summer also grow there in the winter because they do not have to await their causes to be produced. It also follows that to obtain fruit and reap harvests the people of this world do not have to work hard in a hundred different ways such as gathering seeds and cultivating crops because fruit and other produce arise naturally without causes.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">We cannot apprehend the fragrance and colour of an upala flower that grows in the sky because there is nothing to be known. In the same way, if living beings are empty of causes they are unapprehendable because there is nothing to be known. Living beings change continually because they are produced afresh in each moment. However, according to you there is no production because there are no causes, and since it is not possible for living beings to exist without being produced it follows that living beings do not exist at all. Clearly this is not the case because a very colourful world inhabited by living beings is apprehended. Therefore, living beings are produced from causes. When you see blue, for example, your mind apprehending blue is produced in dependence on the colour blue that is its cause. In the same way, you should understand that the world and its inhabitants are produced only in dependence on causes.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Charavakas</span> We can say that the world and its inhabitants arise from the maturation of the four basic elements &ndash; earth, wind, fire and water. Even mind arises from these elements. For example, just as a state of inebriation arises from a potential within alcohol so a state of consciousness arises from a potential within the elements. The consciousness of a new-born child arises from the elements of the mother’s ovum and the father’s sperm, therefore there is no need to posit a previous mental continuum. Whatever is produced exists only within this present life; there is no evidence for the existence of future lives. There are three reasons why future lives do not exist &ndash; (1) we cannot see future lives (2) the mind of this life is produced only from the elements of this life and not from a previous mental continuum and (3) since mind and body are the same substance the mind dies when the body dies. Therefore there are no past or <a id="calibre_link-1912"></a>future lives. This is clearly explained in the works of our founder.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Madhyamika-Prasangikas</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.101] The nature of those elements that are the objects of your mind</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Is not the nature of this.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">How could one who has such thick mental darkness here</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.102] You should realize that when you deny the world beyond</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">You are conceptualizing the nature of objects of knowledge with a wrong view</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Because you have a body that is a basis for developing such a view.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">It is the same when you assert the nature of the elements to be existent.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.103] How these elements do not exist has already been explained.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">How? Because production from self, other, both and no cause</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Have already been refuted in general above.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Therefore, these unmentioned elements also do not exist.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Your first reason is not valid because it does not follow that something does not exist just because you are unable to see it. You have thick mental darkness even with respect to the gross objects of this life so how could you be expected to realize correctly the subtle phenomena of past and future lives? Your confusion about the manifest objects of this life is illustrated by your second reason. The nature of those gross elements such as the <a id="calibre_link-1913"></a>body that are the objects of your knowledge is not the same nature as the mind. If mind can develop merely from physical elements without a previous mental continuum then soil, wind, fire and water can generate new consciousness and become living beings. Since this is clearly impossible, your second reason is also invalid.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">As for your third reason, <a id="calibre_link-1914"></a>mind and body are not the same substance because they are different in aspect, function and entity. In aspect, mind is empty of form, invisible and completely lacking in physical properties, whereas body is form, visible, and possesses many physical properties. Mind functions to cognize, discriminate and experience objects but body cannot perform any of these functions. Mind is like a guest and the body is like its guest house; thus they are completely different entities. Even in this life the mind can be made to leave the body and return to it, or even to enter another body, so how can mind and body be the same substance?</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">It is all very well for you to refer to your founder’s book but if we examine how it came about we will see that it is not a valid scripture. Your founder engaged in many inappropriate actions and composed a long book of a hundred thousand verses only to protect his reputation and justify his lifestyle. In this book he denies the existence of past and future lives, the faults of negative actions, the benefits of virtuous actions, the laws of karma, hidden phenomena and valid cognizers other than direct perceivers. This book may be popular with you Charavakas but no intelligent person would refer to it.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">You should realize that when you deny past and future lives you are conceptualizing the nature of objects of knowledge wrongly because you have taken rebirth as a Charavaka and so have become a basis for holding such a wrong view. It is the same when you assert the nature of the four elements to be truly existent. How these elements do not truly exist has already been explained above. We have already given a general refutation of production from self, other, both and no cause and although the four elements were not specifically mentioned they were included in the refutation. Therefore these elements also do not truly exist.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE <a id="calibre_link-1915"></a>MEANING ESTABLISHED BY THE REFUTATION OF THE FOUR EXTREMES OF PRODUCTION</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.104ab] Since production from self, other, both, or without depending on a cause do not exist</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Things are free from inherent existence.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">If things were inherently existent they would have to be produced from self, from other, from both self and other or without depending on a cause. These four extremes exhaust all possibilities. Since it has been conclusively established that production from self, other, both or without depending on a cause do not exist, we can know with certainty that things are free from inherent existence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The refutation of the four extremes of production enables us to accomplish three great results:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	Through contemplating that things are not produced from self, other, both, or without a cause we realize that things lack inherent existence.</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(2)	Through meditating on the <a id="calibre_link-1916"></a>lack of inherent existence of things we gain a deep experience of emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-last">(3)	Through this experience eventually we attain <a id="calibre_link-1917"></a>liberation, the permanent cessation of all suffering.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">These attainments are possible because of the extensive explanation of the refutation of the four extremes of production given above. Therefore studying this subject has great meaning.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">Just as when it rains a mass of dark cloud obscures the sky, so <a id="calibre_link-1918"></a>worldly beings have thick <a id="calibre_link-1919"></a>confusion that obscures the nature of things. Objects appear incorrectly to them and they apprehend things as inherently existent. Some people, due to visual impairments such as floaters, see floating hairs, two moons, auras of light resembling peacocks’ feathers and flies where there are none. Even though none of these things exists they are wrongly apprehended as existent because the <a id="calibre_link-1920"></a>sense powers are impaired. Similarly, even though there are no inherently existent things worldly beings apprehend things to be inherently existent due to the confusion in their minds.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">In <a id="calibre_link-1921"></a><span class="italic">Dependent Relationship Sutra</span> Buddha says that <a id="calibre_link-1922"></a>dependent-related compositional actions arise in dependence on <a id="calibre_link-1923"></a>dependent-related ignorance and that without dependent-related ignorance there can be no dependent-related compositional actions. Certainly only the unwise conceptualize this to mean that inherently existent actions arise from inherently existent ignorance. The wise, through correctly realizing <a id="calibre_link-1924"></a>dependent relationship with the sun of their excellent minds, understand the lack of inherent existence of compositional actions and thereby eliminate the thick darkness of ignorance. As a result they are <a id="calibre_link-1925"></a>liberated from samsara. Worldly beings, on the other hand, cling to things as inherently existent and so continue to experience relentless suffering. From this we can see that if we want freedom from the sufferings of samsara we should give up worldly views and follow the view of the wise Madhyamikas.</p>

These objects are similar to a child of a childless woman in that they lack inherent existence, but they are not similar in all respects because forms and other things exist whereas a child of a childless woman does not. If they were similar in all respects, a child of a childless woman would appear clearly to a valid mind just as forms and other things do.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-1930"></a>Forms lack inherent existence and are merely imputed by conceptual thought, but they exist because they each have a valid <a id="calibre_link-1931"></a>basis of <a id="calibre_link-1932"></a>imputation and thus are able to perform their respective functions. A child of a childless woman also lacks inherent existence and is merely imputed by conceptual thought, but there is no valid basis of imputation for a child of a childless woman and so it does not exist and does not perform any function. Therefore you are quite wrong to say that forms must be non-existent because, like a child of a childless woman, they lack inherent production.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">For you it would also follow that just as we can have clear appearance of a house in a dream so we can also have clear appearance of a child of a childless woman. In a dream we see an actual house even though there is only a dream house. Similarly, we see water where there is only a mirage, a horse where there is only a magician’s illusion, or a face where there is only a reflection. If all these things can appear clearly to our mind even though they do not exist, according to you a child of a childless woman should also appear because it too does not exist. Again, you must understand that things that are similar in some respects are not necessarily similar in all respects.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">It does not follow that if, like a child of a childless woman, things do not exist ultimately, then like a child of a childless woman they also do not exist conventionally and so are unseen by worldly beings.

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">As, for example, without fuel there is no fire.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The reasoning of vajra fragments explicitly establishes <a id="calibre_link-1936"></a>selflessness of phenomena by refuting inherently existent production. Implicitly it reveals the reasoning of <a id="calibre_link-1937"></a>dependent relationship. If things are not produced inherently, or independently, and yet they are produced they must be produced dependently. Because things are not produced without a cause, not from causes such as <a id="calibre_link-1938"></a>Ishvara, particles, nature and so forth, and not from self, other or both, they are not inherently produced; but since they are produced they must be produced dependently.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are three levels of <a id="calibre_link-1939"></a>dependent relationship &ndash; gross, subtle and very subtle. At a gross level things are dependent on their causes, at a subtle level they are dependent on their parts and at a very subtle level they are dependent on mere conceptual <a id="calibre_link-1940"></a>imputation. It is easy to understand gross dependent relationship. For example, it is easy to see how a clay <a id="calibre_link-1941"></a>pot comes into being in dependence on clay, water, a potter’s wheel and so forth. It is more difficult to understand subtle dependent relationship &ndash; how for example that pot exists in dependence on its parts &ndash; and it is even more difficult to understand very subtle dependent relationship &ndash; how the pot exists in dependence on mere conceptual imputation. To realize perfectly very subtle dependent relationship, we first need to realize emptiness by relying on the reasoning presented above. Once we have realized that a pot lacks inherent existence we will come to see how it is established merely by conceptual imputation, and then we will have found the view of the <a id="calibre_link-1942"></a>union of the two truths.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Living beings have countless <a id="calibre_link-1943"></a>wrong views, such as the view that things are produced without causes, the view that things are produced by the god Ishvara, the view that things are produced by any of the four extremes, the view that there are no past and future lives, the view that Buddha, Dharma and <a id="calibre_link-1944"></a>Sangha do not exist, the view that there is no fault in negative actions and no benefit from virtuous actions and so on. These and all other wrong views are conceptions grasping at extremes. They are all included within the <a id="calibre_link-1945"></a>view of existence and the <a id="calibre_link-1946"></a>view of non-existence. The view of existence is a conceptual wrong awareness conceiving the existence of something that does not exist. Its object, an extreme of existence, does not exist. The view of non-existence is a conceptual wrong awareness conceiving the non-existence of something that does exist. Its object, an extreme of non-existence, does not exist. Thus there are two extremes &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-1947"></a>extreme of existence and the <a id="calibre_link-1948"></a>extreme of non-existence &ndash; neither of which exists, and two minds grasping at extremes &ndash; the view of existence and the view of non-existence, both of which exist but are wrong awarenesses. The two extremes are so called because they are like steep precipices that lie on either side of a narrow path. If we cling to either extreme we will be in great danger of falling into lower states.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In the scriptures, conceptions grasping at extremes are called ‘nets’ because for as long as we hold these views we cannot escape from the sufferings of samsara. We are like fish caught in nets who cannot escape the horrible fate that awaits them. Whereas fish are trapped in nets cast by fishermen, we are trapped in nets cast by our self-grasping mind. <a id="calibre_link-1949"></a>Self-grasping is the root of all <a id="calibre_link-1950"></a>deluded views. If we destroy our self-grasping mind this net of wrong conceptions will also be destroyed just as when we cut the root of a tree all its branches die. The best method for destroying our self-grasping is the reasoning of dependent relationship. If we repeatedly contemplate the three levels of dependent relationship we will come to understand how things arise completely dependently and thereby realize the lack of inherent existence, or emptiness, of all things. As we become more familiar with emptiness, our self-grasping will gradually weaken and eventually cease altogether. When this happens, all conceptions grasping at extremes will also cease because without self-grasping they cannot be sustained. In this way, the reasoning of dependent relationship cuts all the nets of deluded views.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">All these conceptions arise only if we grasp at things as inherently existent, but how things do not exist inherently has already been thoroughly explained. Just as a fire cannot burn without fuel, so if we do not cling to things as inherently existent these views grasping at extremes cannot arise.</p>

If in correctly explaining ultimate truth the arguments of others such as the <a id="calibre_link-1957"></a>proponents of things are discredited there is no fault. When the sun rises it naturally dispels darkness, but it is not blamed for doing so. In the same way, when the sun of the Madhyamikas’ wisdom dispels the darkness of others’ wrong interpretations no fault is incurred.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Strong <a id="calibre_link-1958"></a>attachment to one’s own view, anger towards others’ views and seeking to destroy others’ views out of <a id="calibre_link-1959"></a>pride are merely conceptions that bind us even more tightly to samsara and cause us to experience unceasing suffering.

			<p class="text-heading">ESTABLISHING SELFLESSNESS OF PERSONS BY REASONING</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Self, I, person and being are synonyms. Their lack of inherent existence is selflessness of persons. Normally, we grasp very tightly at our self, or I. This makes our mind unpeaceful and causes us to develop desirous attachment, hatred and all the other <a id="calibre_link-1968"></a>delusions. If we study the following instructions carefully we will gain perfect knowledge that an inherently existent I does not exist. If our mind becomes acquainted with this knowledge, gradually our self-grasping and other delusions will be subdued and as a result our everyday problems will disappear and we will experience pure happiness. Eventually we will attain the permanent peace of <a id="calibre_link-1969"></a>liberation or <a id="calibre_link-1970"></a>enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">There now follows an extensive explanation of selflessness of persons. This is presented under the following three headings:</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Yogis negate the self.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">There are two types of <a id="calibre_link-1971"></a><a id="calibre_link-1972"></a>self-grasping of persons &ndash; grasping at one’s own self as <a id="calibre_link-1973"></a>inherently existent and grasping at others’ self as inherently existent. The first is known as the ‘<a id="calibre_link-1974"></a>view of the transitory collection’. This is the source of all delusions and all the faults that they produce such as uncontrolled birth, ageing, sickness and death. It is the very root of <a id="calibre_link-1975"></a>samsara. Therefore, if we wish to escape from samsara and attain complete freedom from suffering we must cut this root by eradicating the view of the transitory collection from our mental continuum. In <a id="calibre_link-1976"></a><span class="italic">Secret of the Superior Tathagatas Sutra</span> Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">If a tree is cut at its root all its branches, twigs and leaves dry up. In the same way, if the view of the transitory collection is pacified by wisdom all the delusions and secondary delusions are pacified.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-1977"></a>view of the transitory collection is a type of self-grasping of persons that grasps one’s own I as being an inherently existent I. The observed object of the <a id="calibre_link-1978"></a>view of the transitory collection is the I within one’s own continuum, the I that is merely imputed on one’s own <a id="calibre_link-1979"></a>aggregates. This I exists. The conceived object of the <a id="calibre_link-1980"></a>view of the transitory collection is this conventionally existent I as an inherently existent I. This I does not exist.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">In <a id="calibre_link-1981"></a><span class="italic">Commentary to Valid Cognition</span> Dharmakirti says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">Without its object being negated</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">Self-grasping cannot be abandoned.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">This means that to abandon the view of the transitory collection we must negate its conceived object, the <a id="calibre_link-1982"></a>inherently existent I, by realizing that it does not exist. Therefore, having understood that the conceived object of the view of the transitory collection is the inherently existent I, those who wish to attain liberation should strive to negate this I. Our success in this, however, will depend on our first correctly identifying the <a id="calibre_link-1983"></a><a id="calibre_link-1984"></a>object of negation, the inherently existent I, or self, within our own experience.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-1985"></a>Inherently existent self, independent self, <a id="calibre_link-1986"></a>truly existent <a id="calibre_link-1987"></a>self, <a id="calibre_link-1988"></a>substantially existent self, self existing from its own side, objectively existing self, naturally existing self and self existing by way of its own nature are all synonyms. None of them exists and they are all the object of negation of subtle <a id="calibre_link-1989"></a>selflessness. We grasp at such a self all the time, even when asleep. All living beings, even tiny ants, have this mind continuously. However, without relying on qualified instructions it is impossible to recognize this mind or to identify its conceived object correctly.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">We grasp at an <a id="calibre_link-1990"></a>inherently existent I in everything that we do. For example, if we go shopping we do not think, ‘My body wants this’, or ‘My mind wants this’, we think only, ‘I want this.’ We grasp at an I that is independent of our body, our mind or any other phenomenon. At that time we are conceiving an inherently existent I within the <a id="calibre_link-1991"></a>collection of our own <a id="calibre_link-1992"></a>aggregates. The mind that conceives this I is the view of the transitory collection. We have to watch our mind closely over a long period before we can identify clearly how this inherently existent I appears to our mind. We also have to rely on correct instructions on the view of the transitory collection and study authentic texts on the middle way. Such time is well spent, however, because without identifying the inherently existent I within our own experience we will not be able to realize its non-existence, selflessness of persons, and without realizing selflessness of persons we will not be able to attain liberation from samsara. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The reasoning that follows establishes perfectly the non-existence of the inherently existent self, but it will have little impact on our mind if we do not first clearly identify the object of negation within our own experience.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">It is helpful to understand the etymology of the term ‘<a id="calibre_link-1993"></a><a id="calibre_link-1994"></a>view of the transitory collection’. According to the Sautrantika school, the view of the transitory collection is a deluded view that observes one’s own aggregates and apprehends a <a id="calibre_link-1995"></a>self-supporting, substantially existent I. Thus, they say that the observed object of this view is one’s five aggregates. According to them, it is the aggregates themselves that are the ‘transitory collection’. They are transitory because they are <a id="calibre_link-1996"></a>impermanent and a collection because there are several of them. Thus, they assert that the view of the transitory collection observes one’s own aggregates and mistakenly apprehends a self-supporting, substantially existent I within them.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">According to the Madhyamika-Prasangika’s explanation, the term ‘transitory collection’ refers not only to our aggregates but also to the I that is imputed on them. The I is impermanent, and so it is transitory and the I is the nature of a collection because it has many parts. The view of the transitory collection, therefore, is a deluded view that observes the I, the impermanent, transitory collection that is merely imputed in dependence on one’s own aggregates, and conceives it to be an inherently existent I.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE WAY TO NEGATE INHERENTLY EXISTENT SELF AND MINE</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This section has two parts:</p>

The inherently existent self is to be negated, but the existent self is not. The existent self performs actions, experiences their effects, takes rebirth in samsara, experiences suffering and experiences happiness. It is the very basis of both samsara and liberation. Among both non-Buddhists and Buddhists there are many different views on the nature of the self but only the <a id="calibre_link-2000"></a>Madhyamika-Prasangikas identify it correctly because only they identify the object of negation of subtle selflessness correctly.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">In the next section of the sixth chapter, Chandrakirti establishes the supremacy of the Madhyamika-Prasangika view of the self by refuting the opposing views. This is explained extensively under the following six headings:</p>

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(3)	It is a non-creator. The general principle is the creator of all things because it is the nature or cause of all things. The self is not a creator, merely an experiencer.</p>

There are other Tirthikas who assert a single self that pervades all worlds and their inhabitants.

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">And some assert the mind alone.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Because we are normally satisfied with the <a id="calibre_link-2017"></a>mere name of a person, we can meet people, interact with them and so forth. For example, if we are introduced to someone called Peter we are satisfied with the mere name ‘Peter’ and relate to him accordingly. We do not ask, ‘Where is Peter? What is his real self? Is he within his <a id="calibre_link-2018"></a>aggregates or is he separate from his aggregates?’ Because we do not search for a Peter other than the mere name ‘Peter’ we are able to relate to him and respond to his actions. The non-Buddhists such as the <a id="calibre_link-2019"></a>Samkhyas, however, are not satisfied with the mere name of a person. They want to find an actual person other than the mere name, and because such a person cannot be found within the aggregates they conclude that a person must exist separately from the aggregates. In this way they are led to fabricate the existence of a permanent, partless, causeless <a id="calibre_link-2020"></a>self.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The lower Buddhist schools have a similar problem because they too are not satisfied with the mere name of a person but search for an actual person other than the mere name. They feel that if it were impossible to find a person through searching in this way the person would not exist. In their case, however, they realize that there is no self that is other than the aggregates and so they conclude that the existent self that is the observed object of the view of the transitory collection must be found within the aggregates.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Some Vaibhashikas and some Sautrantikas say that the self cannot be any of the individual aggregates because in the Sutras Buddha says that the self exists in dependence on the collection of the five aggregates. They therefore conclude that the mere collection of all five aggregates is the self and the basis of the <a id="calibre_link-2021"></a>view of the transitory collection grasping at self. Among the Vaibhashikas, there are some <a id="calibre_link-2022"></a>Samittiyas who refer to a Sutra in which Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">O Monks, any Sramana or Brahmin who views the self correctly is viewing correctly only these five, appropriated aggregates.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">and conclude that each of the five aggregates is the self. Other Vaibhashikas refer to other Sutras that say:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">You protect yourself,</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">How could others protect you?</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle">By controlling themselves</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">A controlled mind leads to happiness.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">They understand the first Sutra to say that by controlling your mind you protect yourself and the second Sutra to say that by controlling your mind you become happy. From this they conclude that the mind alone is the self. The Chittamatrins also feel that from among the five aggregates, consciousness is the most suitable to be the self. However, they do not feel that any of the six consciousnesses or the deluded mentality can be the self and so they conclude that the <a id="calibre_link-2023"></a>consciousness-basis-of-all is the <a id="calibre_link-2024"></a>self. Similarly, the Madhyamika-Svatantrikas assert the mental continuum to be the self. In <a id="calibre_link-2025"></a><span class="italic">Blaze of Reasoning</span>, for example, Bhavaviveka says that if we search for the self within the five aggregates it is found within the aggregate of consciousness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">From this we can see that none of the non-Buddhist schools and none of the Buddhist schools below the Madhyamika-Prasangikas is satisfied with the <a id="calibre_link-2026"></a>mere name of a person. They all search for a self other than the mere name and claim that such a self can be found. This indicates that they do not understand that the self is empty of inherent existence and exists only as <a id="calibre_link-2027"></a>mere conceptual imputation. This view is taught only by the Madhyamika-Prasangika school.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The first Sutra reveals that past, future, <a id="calibre_link-2034"></a>space, <a id="calibre_link-2035"></a>nirvana and person are mere conceptual <a id="calibre_link-2036"></a>imputations. Therefore they are all imputedly existent not <a id="calibre_link-2037"></a>substantially existent. The second Sutra also reveals that living beings are imputedly existent because they are <a id="calibre_link-2038"></a>merely imputed in dependence on the aggregates. Since you proponents of things and Madhyamika-Svatantrikas accept these Sutras to be of definitive meaning, it follows that you are in contradiction with Buddha’s teachings. Furthermore, if the self is substantially existent it follows that the view of the transitory collection is not a wrong conception because its conceived object, a substantially existent self, actually exists. Therefore the view of the transitory collection is not the root of samsara, there is no need to abandon it and Buddha’s teachings on emptiness are pointless.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">According to the Madhyamika-Prasangikas, an imputedly existent phenomenon is any phenomenon that is merely imputed by conception. Since all phenomena are merely imputed by conception, it follows that all phenomena are <a id="calibre_link-2039"></a>imputedly existent. There are no <a id="calibre_link-2040"></a>substantially existent phenomena because to be substantially existent a phenomenon would have to be inherently existent, existing independently of conceptual imputation, and no phenomenon exists in this way. The lower schools have a different explanation. For them, both imputedly existent phenomena and substantially existent phenomena exist.</p>

Therefore, if our aggregates are the self it follows that the continuum of our self also ceases at that time, and once we become a Foe Destroyer we will have no future rebirths and so our attainment of liberation will have been pointless. If you believe this you fall into the extreme of non-existence.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">(4) <span class="italic">It follows that it is impossible to remember former lives.</span> If the aggregates are the self then in each life before attaining nirvana there is no cause for the birth or death of the self because the self is inherently existent. Therefore there is no connection between the present self and the previous self and so it is impossible to remember former <a id="calibre_link-2043"></a>lives. If this is the case, what are we to make of Buddha’s <a id="calibre_link-2044"></a><span class="italic">Birth Stories</span> in which he recounts from memory the experiences of his former lives?</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Moreover, it follows that <a id="calibre_link-2045"></a>actions are exhausted without their effects being experienced because former and later selves have no connection.

According to some texts, ‘<a id="calibre_link-2048"></a>world’ in this context refers to self and Buddha’s silence is taken to imply that the self has no end. On the other hand, Buddha clearly states elsewhere that the continuum of the contaminated <a id="calibre_link-2049"></a>aggregates has an end. When we become a <a id="calibre_link-2050"></a>Foe Destroyer or a Buddha our contaminated aggregates cease. However, the self does not cease. It becomes a pure <a id="calibre_link-2051"></a>self. Therefore, since we cannot find an end to the self but we can find an end to these aggregates, the assertion that the aggregates are the self is untenable.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">This Sutra teaches that with sincere practice we can lay the foundation of the <a id="calibre_link-2061"></a>Dharma Jewel in our mental continuum and through these realizations protect ourself from suffering. Therefore, if we practise Dharma sincerely we can become our own protector. On the other hand, if we engage in <a id="calibre_link-2062"></a>non-virtuous actions we will bring suffering on ourself, in which case we will become our own enemy. Either way, whether we are doing good or evil, we know what we are doing and so we are our own witness. Those who are wise control their mind through the practice of Dharma and thereby attain rebirth as a human or god and eventually liberation from samsara. All these activities are functions of the self, but they are not functions of a mere collection of aggregates. A collection of aggregates is not a protector, subduer or witness. Therefore, since a <a id="calibre_link-2063"></a>substantially existent collection of aggregates that can perform all these functions of the self does not exist, the self is not the collection of the aggregates.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">REJECTING AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The Sutra we have just quoted explains that just as a cart is dependent on the collection of its parts, so the self is dependent on the collection of the aggregates. Therefore the mere collection of the aggregates is not the self. Precisely speaking, the meaning of this is that just as a cart is merely imputed by conception in dependence on the collection of its parts, so the self is merely imputed by conception in dependence on the collection of the <a id="calibre_link-2065"></a>aggregates. Thus the mere collection of the aggregates is the <a id="calibre_link-2066"></a>basis for imputing the self, and the self is the object imputed on that basis. Since with respect to one object it is impossible for something to be both the <a id="calibre_link-2067"></a>basis of imputation and the <a id="calibre_link-2068"></a>imputed object, it follows that the mere collection of the parts of the cart cannot be the cart and the mere collection of the aggregates cannot be the self.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">All Buddhist schools quote the Sutra referred to by the <a id="calibre_link-2069"></a>Samittiyas as a source for identifying the self, but with the exception of the Madhyamika-Prasangikas they all misinterpret it. The lower schools all feel that there must be more to the self than the mere term ‘<a id="calibre_link-2070"></a>self’, and so they search for a self within its basis of imputation. Although they all have different explanations of the nature of the self they all mistakenly assume that the self can be found within its basis of imputation. They make the same mistake with all other <a id="calibre_link-2071"></a>conventional objects such as carts and pots. However, the truth of the matter is that if we are not satisfied with the <a id="calibre_link-2072"></a>mere name of an object and search for it within its basis of imputation we will not find it. This is because all objects are merely imputed by conception in dependence on their basis of imputation and so the basis of imputation of an object cannot be the object itself.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Only the Madhyamika-Prasangikas can give a flawless explanation of how to identify conventional objects, whether internal objects such as the self or external objects such as pots.

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Other Samittiyas</span> It is not the mere collection of the parts that is the cart but the <a id="calibre_link-2074"></a>shape of the arrangement of those parts. When we see the shape of a cart we say, ‘There is a cart.’ Similarly when we see the shape of a cow we say, ‘There is a cow.’ It is the same with all other living beings &ndash; we identify them by their shape. Thus although the mere collection of the aggregates is not the self, the shape of the aggregates is.</p>

If the self is form then since the <a id="calibre_link-2076"></a>form <a id="calibre_link-2077"></a>aggregate ceases at the time of death it follows that the self also ceases and so there are no future lives.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The shape of a cart is not the cart but a part of the cart, which is why we call it the shape <span class="italic">of</span> the cart and not the cart. It is true that when we see the shape of something such as a car or a watch we say, ‘There is a car’ or ‘There is a watch’, but this is because a car, for example, is not a different entity from its shape, not because a car is its shape. If we are not satisfied with the mere shape of a car and search further we will not find a car because a car is merely imputed in dependence on its shape. When worldly people see the shape of a car they are perfectly satisfied that there is a car, exchange money for it and drive it away. Unlike the lower schools, they do not search for the car within its basis of imputation. Thus the lower schools contradict the beliefs of worldly people.</p>

Since the aggregates are appropriated by the self, the self is the appropriator and the aggregates are the object appropriated. Therefore, it is not possible for the aggregates to be the self.

In <a id="calibre_link-2080"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> Nagarjuna says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last">You should understand appropriation in the same way.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This means that just as the agent and the object of the action are mutually dependent, so too are appropriator and appropriated. Since it is impossible for them to be identical, it is impossible for the self to be the aggregates.</p>

If you think that the object of an action can exist without the agent, this is not possible because if there is no agent there is no action, and if there is no action there is no object of the action. In other words, if there is no self to appropriate the aggregates there is no action of appropriating and so there are no appropriated aggregates.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">It has already been established that the <a id="calibre_link-2108"></a>self is neither inherently other than nor inherently one with the aggregates. Now Chandrakirti refutes three other positions &ndash; that the self inherently depends on the aggregates, that the aggregates inherently depend on the self and that the self inherently possesses the aggregates.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The self is not within the aggregates in the sense of being a dependent inherently depending on the aggregates as its basis, and the self is not the basis on which the aggregates inherently depend. If the self and the aggregates were inherently other then there would be these conceptualizations of inherently existent dependent and basis, but since they are not inherently other these ideas are just wrong conceptions. Therefore the self does not inherently depend on the aggregates and the aggregates do not inherently depend on the self.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Furthermore, the self does not inherently possess the aggregate of form or any of the other aggregates because the self and the aggregates depend on other phenomena such as their causes and therefore do not inherently exist. Therefore there is no relationship of inherently existent possession between the self and the aggregates. There are two ways we can possess things &ndash; we can possess things that are a different entity from ourself &ndash; as a man possesses money or a farmer possesses cows &ndash; or we can possess things that are the same entity as ourself &ndash; as a man possesses his physical form. However, in neither sense does the self inherently possess the aggregates. For example, if the self inherently possessed the aggregate of form in the first sense then the self would be inherently other than form, and if it inherently possessed the aggregate of form in the second sense it would be inherently one with form; but since the self is neither inherently other than nor inherently one with the aggregate of form neither of these relationships obtains. Just as the self does not inherently possess the aggregate of form, so it does not inherently possess the aggregates of feeling, discrimination, compositional factors or consciousness.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Are destroyed along with the self.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">So far, Chandrakirti has refuted five positions &ndash; that the self is inherently other than the aggregates, that the self is inherently one with the aggregates, that the self is inherently dependent on the aggregates, that the self is the basis on which the aggregates inherently depend, and that the self inherently possesses the aggregates. By realizing these refutations we will <a id="calibre_link-2109"></a>realize that the self is empty of inherent existence, and we will also come to understand the nature of the root and peak views of the transitory collection.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The root view of the transitory collection is the actual <a id="calibre_link-2110"></a>view of the transitory collection already explained. It has two types &ndash; the view of the transitory collection conceiving I and the view of the transitory collection conceiving mine. The first observes only the I within our continuum and conceives it to be inherently existent. The second observes both the I and mine within our continuum and conceives mine to be inherently existent. It is important to identify the observed object of the <a id="calibre_link-2111"></a>view of the transitory collection conceiving mine. The <a id="calibre_link-2112"></a>view of the transitory collection is necessarily a self-grasping of persons that conceives one’s own I to be inherently existent, and it necessarily takes the I within one’s own continuum as its observed object. The <a id="calibre_link-2113"></a>view of the transitory collection conceiving mine, therefore, must observe our own I and conceive it to be inherently existent. When we see the aspect of other things such as our clothes or our body we develop a sense of ‘mine’. At such times we are observing our I as a possessor, as ‘mine’, and conceiving it to be inherently existent. Thus ‘mine’ in this context refers not to the objects that are being held as mine but to the subject who is being held as the possessor. If ‘mine’ referred to the objects such as our clothes or our <a id="calibre_link-2114"></a>body then the observed object would be a phenomenon other than persons and the mind grasping them to be inherently existent would be a self-grasping of phenomena not a self-grasping of persons. Even so, it is not incorrect to say that objects such as our clothes or our body are instances of mine.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Both the <a id="calibre_link-2115"></a>view of the transitory collection conceiving I and the view of the transitory collection conceiving mine have innate and intellectually-formed types. Every <a id="calibre_link-2116"></a>living being apart from those about to become <a id="calibre_link-2117"></a>Foe Destroyers, Foe Destroyers themselves and Bodhisattvas on the <a id="calibre_link-2118"></a>eighth, <a id="calibre_link-2119"></a>ninth and <a id="calibre_link-2120"></a>tenth grounds has the innate view of the transitory collection all the time, even when asleep. Take for example a tiny insect such as an ant. If we put a finger in the path of an ant it will either flee in the opposite direction or freeze and pretend to be dead until the danger has passed. This is a perfect sign that it has the view of the transitory collection strongly grasping at I. The ant does not need to investigate through reasoning to generate this mind, it automatically grasps at I through the force of imprints in its mental continuum. This is why this view is called the ‘innate’ view of the transitory collection.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Even though the innate view of the transitory collection functions in ordinary beings all the time, binding them to samsara and condemning them to perpetual suffering, there are very few people who are even aware of its existence. Without receiving Dharma instructions we will never understand the nature or function of the view of the transitory collection. Although there are countless living beings only a few have the opportunity to receive these instructions. Such people are indeed very fortunate, but even they will not be able to escape from samsara if their experience of the view of the transitory collection remains a mere intellectual understanding.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">As already explained, to abandon samsara it is necessary to abandon the view of the transitory collection, and to do this we must first identify it clearly within our own experience. We have to watch our mind over a long period until we clearly recognize the view of the transitory collection within our own continuum. Only then will we be able to abandon it and attain liberation. Therefore, having attained a <a id="calibre_link-2121"></a>precious human life and having met the Dharma that explains the view of the transitory collection, we should now strive to identify this view within our own mind. Not to do so would be a tragic waste of a rare and precious opportunity.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The peak <a id="calibre_link-2122"></a>views of the transitory collection are intellectually-formed views. Unlike the innate view, intellectually-formed views of the transitory collection do not arise naturally from imprints in the mental continuum but develop as a result of misguided reasoning. For example, if we investigate the nature of our I and erroneously conclude that it must be inherently existent, we will have generated an intellectually-formed view of the transitory collection.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Buddha listed twenty different intellectually-formed views of the transitory collection. They are:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	The view holding our aggregate of form to be an inherently existent I</p>

			<p class="text-list-10-to-99-with-parenthesis-middle">(18)	The view holding our aggregate of consciousness to be possessed by an inherently existent I</p>
			<p class="text-list-10-to-99-with-parenthesis-middle">(19)	The view holding our aggregate of consciousness to be the basis on which an inherently existent I depends</p>
			<p class="text-list-10-to-99-with-parenthesis-last">(20)	The view holding our aggregate of consciousness to be dependent on an inherently existent I</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Our <a id="calibre_link-2123"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-2124"></a>form is not an inherently existent I, but the first view holds it to be so. An inherently existent I does not possess our aggregate of form, but the second view holds our aggregate of form to be possessed by an inherently existent I. An inherently existent I does not depend on our aggregate of form, but the third view holds our aggregate of form to be the basis on which an inherently existent I depends. Our aggregate of form does not depend on an inherently existent I but the fourth view holds our aggregate of form to be dependent on an inherently existent I. The remaining sixteen views can be understood in the same way.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">We might wonder why the position of the self being inherently other than the five aggregates is not included in this list, with twenty-five views being enumerated. The reason is that these twenty views are misconceptions that observe the aggregates, not entities other than the aggregates. Because they observe the aggregates and not the I these twenty views are not self-grasping of persons and so they are not actual views of the transitory collection. They are called ‘views of the transitory collection’ because they observe the transitory collection of the aggregates. Calling them ‘views of the transitory collection’ also serves to highlight the fact that the actual view of the transitory collection arises only when one or more of the aggregates appears to the mind.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">These twenty intellectually-formed views arise in dependence on the actual innate view of the transitory collection. Thus the innate view of the transitory collection is likened to a vast range of mountains standing solidly in the mind and the twenty intellectually-formed views are likened to high peaks that stand out from this range. In one Sutra, Buddha says:</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-prose-single">When the twenty high mountain peaks of the view of the transitory collection have been destroyed by the vajra of exalted awareness, the accomplishment of Stream Enterer will be experienced directly.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">This means that when a Hinayana practitioner attains the path of seeing, the vajra of his or her exalted awareness directly realizing selflessness destroys these twenty intellectually-formed views and he or she attains the accomplishment of a <a id="calibre_link-2125"></a><a id="calibre_link-2126"></a>Stream Enterer.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">The self does not exist because it lacks the characteristics of things.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">According to you, mind is substantially existent and so you do not assert it to be indescribable as either identical to or different from form. So why do you assert a substantially existent self to be indescribable in these ways? If the self is a substantially existent thing then, like mind, it is not indescribable because it must be either substantially identical with the aggregates or substantially different from them.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">On the other hand, you say that a pot is not substantially existent and so is indescribable with respect to its parts &ndash; form and so forth &ndash; and for this very reason you say it is <a id="calibre_link-2129"></a>imputedly existent. By the same token, if you say that the self is indescribable with respect to its aggregates you should say that it too is imputedly existent, not substantially existent.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">You say that consciousness is not other than its own nature but that it is other than form and so forth. These two aspects, being one with itself and different from other things, are essential characteristics of all things, but you say that the self lacks these characteristics. Therefore, it follows that the self does not exist.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">These three verses refute a substantially existent self and establish an imputedly existent self. The Samittiyas assert the self to be substantially existent but according to the Madhyamika-Prasangikas this is impossible. <a id="calibre_link-2130"></a>Substantially existent means existing without being imputed by conception.

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">It is not the mere collection and it is not the shape.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">From the above it is clear that the existent I that is the observed object of the <a id="calibre_link-2133"></a>view of the transitory collection grasping at I is not <a id="calibre_link-2134"></a>inherently existent. An inherently existent self cannot be other than the aggregates or the same entity as the aggregates. It cannot depend on the aggregates and it cannot possess the aggregates. On the other hand, the existent I that is the observed object of the view of the transitory collection is not its aggregates, is the same entity as its aggregates, is dependent on its aggregates and possesses its aggregates. Therefore the I is not inherently existent but exists as a mere conceptual imputation in dependence on the aggregates.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Great skill is required to distinguish the observed object of the <a id="calibre_link-2135"></a>view of the transitory collection, which does exist, from the conceived object, which does not.

			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Chandrakirti uses the analogy of the cart to show how the I cannot be found and yet exists. If we are not satisfied with the <a id="calibre_link-2136"></a>mere name ‘cart’ and search further we will not find a cart. A cart is not other than its parts, it is not one with its parts, it does not possess its parts, it is not within its parts, its parts are not within it, it is not the mere collection of its parts and it is not the shape of its parts. Nevertheless a cart does exist merely imputed by conceptual mind in dependence on the collection of its parts, which is its basis of imputation. In just the same way, even though we cannot find the I on investigation, nevertheless it exists merely imputed by conceptual mind in dependence on its basis of imputation, the collection of the aggregates.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">AN EXTENSIVE EXPLANATION OF THE TWO POSITIONS NOT PREVIOUSLY EXPLAINED</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This section has two parts:</p>

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Transferring this reason to others</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE ACTUAL MEANING</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">In the analogy of the cart just given, Chandrakirti refutes seven positions, adding two to the previous five. The two remaining positions are (1) that a cart is the mere collection of its parts and (2) that a cart is the mere shape of its parts. These are now refuted extensively under the following two headings:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Refuting the assertion that a cart is the mere <a id="calibre_link-2137"></a>collection of its parts</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Refuting the assertion that a cart is the mere shape of its parts</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Proponents of things</span> If we are not satisfied with the mere name ‘cart’ and search further, we do find a cart because it is the mere collection of its parts.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.152ab] If the mere collection is a cart</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Then that cart exists in the pieces that remain.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">If a cart is the mere collection of its parts then if a cart is dismantled and all its parts placed in a heap that cart exists in those pieces because they are the mere collection of its parts.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Objection</span> You cannot say that when a cart is dismantled the pieces that remain are parts of a cart because at that time there is no cart.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.152cd] Without a part-possessor there are no parts</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Therefore, it is impossible for the mere shape to be the cart.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Do the parts of a cart become non-parts when it is dismantled? If they do, you are wrong to say that the parts are inherently existent because if parts are inherently existent they must remain parts forever. Therefore you cannot avoid the foregoing consequence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Furthermore, the collection of the parts of the cart is itself part of the cart because it is a collection of <span class="italic">parts</span> of the cart. If we look among a flock of sheep, for example, we see only sheep, we do not see anything that is not sheep. In the same way, if we look among the collection of parts of a cart we see only parts of a cart, we do not see anything that is not parts of a cart. Therefore the collection of the parts of a cart is part of the cart. Since a cart is not part of a cart it follows that a cart is not the collection of its parts.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The parts of a cart consist of the individual parts and the collection of the parts. Of the two, the latter is more important because if we possess only the individual parts of a cart we do not possess a cart. A cart comes into being only when its parts are assembled in a particular way. Therefore, the main basis for imputing a cart is the collection of its parts. Since it is the basis for imputing the cart the mere collection of the parts of the cart cannot be the cart.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Since the individual parts and the collection of the parts are parts of a cart none of them is the part-possessor, and since, according to you the cart is its parts it follows that there is no part-possessor. Without a part-possessor there are no parts and if there are no parts there is no collection of parts. Therefore, it is impossible for the mere collection of its parts to be the cart.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The last line of this verse in the root text reads ‘Therefore, it is impossible for the mere shape to be the cart.’ Some texts say that it should be changed to read, ‘Therefore it is impossible for the mere collection to be the cart’ since this is the occasion of refuting the collection of the parts to be a cart. However it is possible to interpret the existing words without contradiction and there is no need to change them.</p>

If you say that the shape of each part is the same after it is assembled, then just as there was no cart when the individual parts were separate so there is no cart when the parts are assembled. If the shapes of the individual parts are not the cart before it is assembled, how can they be the cart when they are assembled if they do not change in the process? If you say that at the time of the cart the wheels, axle and so forth have different shapes from those they had before they were assembled we should be able to see these different shapes, but we cannot.

On the other hand, you say that there is no such thing as a substantially existent collection because a collection is necessarily imputedly existent. Therefore it follows that the collection of the parts of the cart cannot be a basis for imputing the shape of the cart. If the shape is not imputed on the collection of parts it has no basis of imputation on which to depend, so how can the cart be the shape of the collection of its parts? Moreover, the shape of the cart is not the cart because the cart is the possessor and the shape is the possession. Possessor and possession cannot be one.</p>

Because a pot consists of these eight atomic substances, these substances are parts of the pot, but they are not the pot. Therefore it is unsuitable to say that a mind observing a pot observes the eight atomic substances, forms and so forth, that are the collection of its parts. Furthermore, since there is no inherently existent production the eight atomic substances, form and so forth, that are the basis of imputation do not exist substantially.

You, however, defy worldly conventions and thereby fail to account for anything. In fact the fault that you attribute to us, that we deny the existence of everything, actually applies to you. Take a cart for example. It has been proven that a cart does not exist within its individual parts or within the collection of its parts, and yet you deny the existence of a cart merely imputed in dependence on its parts. Therefore, according to you there is no cart and by the same token there is no pot, no car, no house and so on.

			<p class="text-1st-para">How can it be said that a cart that is non-existent in the seven ways exists inherently when its inherent existence is not found even by Yogis? When Yogis analyze a cart, for example, in the seven ways, and fail to find a cart they easily realize the lack of inherent existence of the cart. Through realizing the emptiness of the cart they then realize its subtle <a id="calibre_link-2148"></a>conventional nature, that it is <a id="calibre_link-2149"></a>mere name. In the Madhyamika-Prasangika system we assert the existence of things such as carts in just the same way as they are realized by these Yogis.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">If you proponents of lower tenets want to be free from faults and gain a perfect understanding of the two truths you should abandon your mistaken views and take up the system of the Madhyamika-Prasangikas. In this system we assert that all things such as carts are mere name and we do not search further. In this way we can give a flawless presentation of the <a id="calibre_link-2150"></a>two truths and avoid falling into the <a id="calibre_link-2151"></a>extremes of existence and non-existence.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">REJECTING AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">As already explained, a cart is not inherently existent because it cannot be found by the sevenfold analysis. If a cart does not inherently exist there is no inherently existent part-possessor, and so the parts also do not inherently exist. For example, if the part-possessor, the cart, is burned by fire its parts are also burned and no longer exist. Likewise, when the fuel of the self-grasping mind apprehending an inherently existent part-possessor is consumed by the fire of wisdom realizing emptiness, so too is the self-grasping mind apprehending inherently existent parts. Thus neither the cart nor its parts are inherently existent.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The analogy of a cart is given to help us understand how the self is not inherently existent but is merely imputed in dependence on its parts. Of course any other object could have been taken as an analogy but it is useful when examining an internal object such as the self to take an external object such as a cart as an analogy. Just as a cart cannot be found when analyzed in the seven ways neither can the self, and just as a cart exists as mere imputation so too does the self. In just the same way, the self is established by <a id="calibre_link-2152"></a>worldly renown as an appropriator merely imputed in dependence on its parts &ndash; the five aggregates, the six elements and the six sources. All these are the appropriated, the object of the action, and the self is the appropriator, the agent of the action.</p>

We will realize all this simply from realizing that the self is empty of inherent existence. Why is this? It is because once we have realized the emptiness of a characterized phenomenon we automatically realize the emptiness of all its characteristics.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">From this we can understand that the realization that the self is not inherently existent but dependently imputed enables us to overcome not only the view of the transitory collection but also all other <a id="calibre_link-2153"></a>deluded views.

This means that it exists by way of being apprehended by the <a id="calibre_link-2157"></a>valid cognizers of worldly beings. Because the <a id="calibre_link-2158"></a>valid cognizers of <a id="calibre_link-2159"></a>worldly people apprehend the I, the I exists. Thus the I is a mere apprehension of the valid minds of worldly people &ndash; it is mere imputation, mere name. If we are satisfied with this mere apprehension, this mere name, ‘I’, it exists and functions, but if we are not satisfied and search for it we will not find it.</p>

			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">It is important to stress again the need to put great effort into distinguishing the existent self that is the observed object of the <a id="calibre_link-2164"></a>view of the transitory collection from the non-existent self that is its conceived object. To do this we must first realize the lack of inherent existence of the self by analyzing it in seven ways like a <a id="calibre_link-2165"></a>cart.

Buddha accepted all these things just as worldly people impute them. He would never argue with <a id="calibre_link-2168"></a>worldly people about what they realize with their <a id="calibre_link-2169"></a>valid cognizers.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Furthermore, objects such as parts and part-possessors, qualities and quality-possessors, attachment and people with attachment, characteristics and bases of characteristics and firewood and fire are also not inherently existent because they do not exist in seven ways when analyzed like a cart, but they do exist by way of <a id="calibre_link-2170"></a>worldly renown because they are all imputed in dependence on valid names by worldly people. Thus we should be satisfied with all these things as mere names just as they are imputed by worldly people; then we will have no difficulty in establishing the two truths of phenomena such as pots and woollen cloth. For example, the lack of inherent existence of a pot is an <a id="calibre_link-2171"></a>ultimate truth and the pot existing as mere imputation by conception is a <a id="calibre_link-2172"></a>conventional truth. If we are not satisfied with the mere names of things and search further we will find it impossible to establish either of the <a id="calibre_link-2173"></a>two truths, and like the <a id="calibre_link-2174"></a>proponents of things fall into the <a id="calibre_link-2175"></a>two extremes.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para"><span class="bold"><a id="calibre_link-2176"></a></span>Cause and effect are also not inherently existent. For example, if a cause such as a seed produces a product such as a sprout it is a cause, but if no effect is produced by that seed it is not a cause. Therefore causes depend on their effects. Since we can see clearly that all effects such as sprouts are produced by their causes effects also depend on their causes. Since cause and effect are mutually dependent they lack inherent existence and, like a <a id="calibre_link-2177"></a>cart, cannot be found on investigation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">If you assert that cause and effect are inherently existent, then what arises from what and what precedes what? Do effects arise from causes or do causes arise from effects? Do causes precede effects or do effects precede causes? If you say that effects arise from causes, you contradict your assertion that effects are inherently existent because something that is inherently existent does not depend on causes. If you say that causes arise from effects you will only lay yourselves open to ridicule. If you say that causes precede effects then since causes are inherently existent they never cease and if causes never cease effects are never produced because effects arise only on the cessation of their causes. If you say that effects precede causes, again you will simply lay yourselves open to ridicule.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Furthermore, if you say that cause and effect are inherently existent do causes meet their effects or not? If you say that a cause produces an effect through meeting do the cause and effect meet like one person meeting another or do they meet like water flowing into water? If you say it is like one person meeting another cause and effect are simultaneous, but this is impossible. If you say that a cause meets its effect like water flowing into water it follows that cause and effect mingle and become one potential, like a river flowing into a lake. Since they are the same potential they are identical and so cause and effect are not different, which is absurd. If you assert that a cause produces an effect without meeting it then since, according to you cause and effect are inherently different they are completely unrelated. If effects can arise from causes with which they are completely unrelated there is no distinction between cause and non-cause, which is absurd. When a cause produces an effect it must do so either by meeting or by not meeting; there is no third possibility. Since for you neither of these can be established this is a clear indication that you have no correct reasons for saying that cause and effect are inherently existent. If you say that inherently existent causes do not produce effects there are no inherently existent effects, and since without its producing an effect there is no reason for calling it a cause you should also say that causes do not exist inherently.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Just as our refutations of others’ positions exist nominally, so too do proofs within our own tradition. Even though nothing exists inherently, nevertheless causes produce effects, and correct reasons prove the objects to be established. For example, if we want to look at the sun at the time of an eclipse both the orb of the sun and its characteristics can be seen by looking at its reflection in water. The reflection of the sun is not inherently existent and if we search for it by investigating whether it meets with the sun or not we will not find it. Nevertheless, it arises in dependence on the sun and exists merely nominally. What is more, it is a reliable sign indicating the characteristics of the sun in the sky. Similarly, a <a id="calibre_link-2182"></a>reflection of a face in a mirror is not truly existent because if we investigate to see whether it meets the actual face or not we will not find it. Nevertheless, it exists nominally and we can use it to clean or beautify our face. Just as a reflection of a face lacks inherent existence but is effective in helping to clean the face, so within the Madhyamika position our reasons are effective in cleaning the stains of ignorance from the wisdom face of our opponents such as you proponents of things. Although our reasons such as the reasoning of <a id="calibre_link-2183"></a>dependent relationship and the <a id="calibre_link-2184"></a><a id="calibre_link-2185"></a>sevenfold reasoning are not inherently existent, you should know that with them you can realize the object to be established, lack of inherent existence.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">With our valid reasons and analogies we can very easily lead others to realize that all things lack inherent existence, but because you have no valid reasons or analogies you cannot make others accept inherent existence in the same way.

Worldly beings are already bound to samsara by the innate <a id="calibre_link-2187"></a><a id="calibre_link-2188"></a>view of the transitory collection and as a result experience relentless suffering. Why do you entrap them further with your net of intellectually-formed views grasping at an inherently existent self? Our task is to help living beings escape from their suffering by abandoning self-grasping, not to lead them to even more suffering by increasing their self-grasping!</p>

Again the proponents of things sought to discredit us by returning our consequence of meeting and so forth, and again we refuted their system and established our own. Having understood this last refutation you should use it here to answer the position of meeting and so forth. Since we have used valid reasons and analogies and since we have not only refuted others’ positions but also established our own, we are not like disputants who only refute. Once you have understood our reasoning you can use it to refute any assertions of the proponents of things that have not been explained above.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The Madhyamika scholars’ principal intention in refuting others’ positions and establishing their own is to free living beings from wrong views and to lead them to the correct view of profound emptiness. In this way they hope to free all living beings from the sufferings of samsara and lead them to the happiness of liberation. Since they are motivated only by the wish to benefit living beings it is advisable to follow them.</p>

			<p class="text-heading">THE DIVISIONS OF EMPTINESS IN BRIEF</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.179] To liberate living beings, the Blessed One said</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">That this selflessness has two types when divided by way of persons and phenomena;</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And then again, according to disciples,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">He explained many divisions of these.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.180] Having extensively explained</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Sixteen emptinesses</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">He again explained four in brief,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">And these are regarded as the Mahayana.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">There are countless objects of knowledge and they are all empty of inherent existence. Because the <a id="calibre_link-2194"></a>emptiness of all phenomena is the same nature, it is not possible to distinguish different types of emptiness from the point of view of their nature. For example, in a row of houses each house is clearly distinguishable because it has a different nature from the others, but the space inside the houses is all the same nature. If the houses were demolished there would be no basis for distinguishing the space of one house from the space of another. The only way to distinguish the space of one house from that of another is with reference to the particular house that encloses it. Similarly, the only way to distinguish different types of emptiness is with reference to the particular <a id="calibre_link-2195"></a>bases of <a id="calibre_link-2196"></a>emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">To liberate living beings from the two obstructions and lead them to enlightenment, Buddha explained two types of emptiness, or selflessness &ndash; <a id="calibre_link-2197"></a>selflessness of persons and <a id="calibre_link-2198"></a>selflessness of phenomena. In this context, ‘phenomena’ means all phenomena other than persons. All emptinesses are included in these two selflessnesses. Although persons and phenomena other than persons are different natures, the selflessness of persons and the selflessness of phenomena are not. They are both simply lack of inherent existence. Thus the division into two selflessnesses is made from the point of view of the bases of emptiness &ndash; persons and phenomena other than persons &ndash; not from the point of view of the emptiness itself.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">Buddha also taught other divisions of emptiness according to the needs of disciples. For example, he gave an extensive explanation of sixteen <a id="calibre_link-2199"></a>emptinesses and a condensed explanation of four emptinesses. The sixteen emptinesses are:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	The emptiness of the inner</p>

			<p class="text-list-10-to-99-with-parenthesis-last">(16)	The emptiness of no thing</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The four emptinesses are:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(1)	The emptiness of things</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(2)	The emptiness of non-things</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(3)	The emptiness of nature</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last">(4)	The emptiness of other entities</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Buddha gave an extensive explanation of emptiness in the <a id="calibre_link-2200"></a>Mahayana Sutras but only a brief explanation in the <a id="calibre_link-2201"></a>Hinayana Sutras.

The remaining five <a id="calibre_link-2202"></a>powers &ndash; ear sense power, nose sense power, tongue sense power, body sense power and mental power &ndash; should be understood in the same way. The six powers are not permanent and they do not inherently disintegrate, therefore they are completely empty of inherent existence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">In general there are two types of phenomenon &ndash; inner and outer. <a id="calibre_link-2203"></a>Inner phenomena are those that are conjoined with a continuum of consciousness and <a id="calibre_link-2204"></a>outer phenomena are those that are not. Within inner phenomena the six powers &ndash; the eye sense power and so forth &ndash; are known as the ‘six inner <a id="calibre_link-2205"></a>sources’ and their lack of inherent existence is called the ‘emptiness of the inner’.

They are inner because they are conjoined with a continuum of consciousness and because they are the basis of mind, and they are outer because they can be seen by eye consciousness. The lack of inherent existence of that which is both inner and outer is called the ‘emptiness of the inner and outer’. Because lack of inherent existence is the ultimate nature of these phenomena it is explained as emptiness by the wise.

To overcome this we must meditate on the emptiness of emptiness. Eventually through this meditation all dualistic appearance subsides into emptiness and only emptiness appears to our mind. At that point our mind mixes with emptiness like water mixing with water. Only with this meditation can we eliminate the <a id="calibre_link-2213"></a>two obstructions and attain enlightenment.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-2214"></a>ten directions are called ‘great’ because they pervade all environments and their beings. When we meditate on the <a id="calibre_link-2215"></a>four immeasurables we cannot find an end to living beings or their various worlds pervading space. In the same way, when we contemplate the ten directions we cannot find an end to them. Therefore they are called ‘great’ and the lack of inherent existence of the ten directions is called the ‘emptiness of the great’.

When the mind is finally freed from the two obstructions the emptiness of the <a id="calibre_link-2217"></a>mind is also freed from them. The emptiness of a mind freed from the two obstructions is a <a id="calibre_link-2218"></a>Truth Body and a nirvana. Because this <a id="calibre_link-2219"></a>nirvana is the ultimate goal, the supreme purpose of every living being, it is called the ‘ultimate’. The lack of inherent existence of ultimate nirvana is called the ‘emptiness of the ultimate’. Buddha taught this emptiness to overcome the mind that apprehends nirvana as inherently existent.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">In general, there are two types of nirvana &ndash; a nirvana that is an abandonment merely of the delusion-obstructions, which is a Hinayana <a id="calibre_link-2220"></a>nirvana, and a nirvana that is an abandonment of both the delusion-obstructions and the obstructions to omniscience, which is a Mahayana <a id="calibre_link-2221"></a>nirvana. Both are necessarily emptiness, ultimate truth. In the <a id="calibre_link-2222"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span> Buddha calls emptiness itself ‘natural <a id="calibre_link-2223"></a>nirvana’ but it is not an actual nirvana.

The definition of <a id="calibre_link-2258"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-2259"></a>discrimination is a mental factor that functions to apprehend the uncommon sign of an object. The definition of <a id="calibre_link-2260"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-2261"></a>compositional factors is any product that is not one of the other four aggregates.

An example is any of the five contaminated aggregates of an ordinary being. The definition of uncontaminated aggregate is an <a id="calibre_link-2268"></a>aggregate that arises in dependence on an uncontaminated wisdom.

The definition of contaminated <a id="calibre_link-2270"></a>element is an element that holds any part of the environment, beings or enjoyments of samsara. In the scriptures, contaminated elements are likened to a poisonous snake because living beings are held within samsara and subjected to suffering in much the same way as a victim is held and tormented by a poisonous snake. There are eighteen contaminated elements. Whatever is a contaminated element is necessarily a product. The contaminated element of phenomena consists of all contaminated mental factors, seeds of delusions, imprints of delusions and so forth.</p>

The root text says ‘coming together’, which means the assembling of causes and conditions. There are two types of produced dependent-related phenomena &ndash; contaminated produced dependent-related phenomena and uncontaminated produced dependent-related phenomena.

The definition of <a id="calibre_link-2283"></a>giving is a virtuous determination to give.

The definition of <a id="calibre_link-2286"></a>effort is a virtuous mind that delights in virtue.

If the practice of giving is conjoined with spontaneous bodhichitta it is a perfection of giving. The remaining five perfections can be understood in the same way.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The root text says that moral discipline is ‘without torment’. This means that a mind controlled by pure moral discipline is free from the pain of the delusions. Patience is said to be ‘without anger’ because a mind controlled by patience is completely free from anger. <a id="calibre_link-2289"></a>Effort is said to be ‘without non-virtue’ because a mind controlled by effort engages only in virtue. Mental stabilization is called ‘gathering’ because developing pure concentration is the basis for gathering all good qualities. Wisdom is said to be ‘without attachment’ because the wisdom realizing emptiness does not grasp at inherent existence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-2290"></a>perfection of giving for a Bodhisattva with sharp faculties is a virtuous determination to give that possesses the three attributes of motivation, helper and function. The motivation for practising the perfection of giving must be to lead all living beings to the bliss of Buddhahood. The ‘<a id="calibre_link-2291"></a>helper’ of the perfection of giving is the wisdom realizing emptiness. For a Bodhisattva with sharp faculties the perfection of giving is necessarily held by this wisdom. A Bodhisattva who has not yet realized emptiness has the practice of the perfection of giving, but not an actual realization of the perfection of giving. The function of the perfection of giving is to eliminate conditions discordant with giving such as miserliness, attachment and self-cherishing, and to ripen living beings. When Bodhisattvas give things to others their main motivation is to establish a good relationship with the recipient so that they can guide them along the spiritual path. For this reason Bodhisattvas sometimes strive to acquire wealth and possessions even though they have no desire for these things from their own side. The remaining five perfections can be understood in the same way.

The definition of the first is the emptiness that is the lack of inherent existence of the entity of any phenomenon. An example is the lack of inherent existence of the entity of a sprout. The definition of the second is the emptiness that is the lack of inherent existence of the cause of any phenomenon. An example is the lack of inherent existence of the cause of a sprout. The definition of the third is the emptiness that is the lack of inherent existence of the effect of any phenomenon. An example is the lack of inherent existence of the effect of a sprout.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Meditation on the first door of perfect liberation leads to a realization that the entities of phenomena lack true existence, and this realization leads to the pacification of the true-grasping that conceives the entities of phenomena to be truly existent. In the root text, ‘not observing’ refers to lack of inherent existence and ‘<a id="calibre_link-2323"></a>isolation’ means liberation. Meditation on the second door of perfect liberation leads to a realization that <a id="calibre_link-2324"></a>causes do not truly exist and this realization leads to the pacification of the true-grasping that conceives the causes of things to be truly existent. Here ‘<a id="calibre_link-2325"></a>sign’ means cause and so ‘signlessness’ means the lack of true existence of causes. Meditation on the third door of perfect liberation leads to a realization that effects do not truly exist and this realization leads us to liberation from the effect of samsara, suffering and its cause, confusion. Here, ‘<a id="calibre_link-2326"></a>wish’ means the objects that are wished for, both those on the side of samsara and those on the side of liberation. ‘Wishlessness’ is the lack of inherent existence of all these objects.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">All three doors of perfect liberation are the same in that they are mere lack of inherent existence. Therefore, strictly speaking there is only one door of perfect liberation &ndash; emptiness. In other texts it says there is only one door of liberation and that besides emptiness a second door cannot be found.

There are ten <a id="calibre_link-2328"></a>forces of a <a id="calibre_link-2329"></a>Buddha, which are explained in detail in the chapter <span class="italic">Resultant Grounds</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of a quality of <a id="calibre_link-2330"></a>fearlessness of a <a id="calibre_link-2331"></a>Buddha is an utterly firm, ultimate realization that is entirely free from fear in expounding Dharma. There are four types &ndash; fearlessness in revealing the Dharma of definite emergence, fearlessness in revealing the Dharma of overcoming obstructions, fearlessness in revealing the Dharma of excellent abandonments and fearlessness in revealing the Dharma of excellent realizations. When <a id="calibre_link-2332"></a>Buddhas give Dharma teachings they have supreme confidence and are completely free from nervousness or hesitation, even if they have to address a vast audience of highly realized beings. With utter confidence they can admit to being fully enlightened and to possessing all the excellent qualities of a Buddha’s body, speech and mind, knowing that there is no one who can refute it. Similarly, they can declare that they have overcome all delusions and their imprints and are completely without faults. Because Buddhas have abandoned all objects to be abandoned, from gross moral faults such as killing to the most subtle <a id="calibre_link-2333"></a>obstructions to omniscience, they can confidently teach others how to do the same. Similarly, they can reveal from their own experience how to accomplish everything that is to be realized. Buddhas understand all these things in general and they also understand how they apply to each individual disciple. Therefore, they always give advice that is perfectly suited to the listener.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-2334"></a>correct, specific cognizer is an ultimate realization that knows the entities, divisions and so forth of all phenomena without error. There are four types &ndash; correct cognizers of specific phenomena, correct cognizers of specific meanings, correct cognizers of specific, definite words and correct cognizers of specific confidence. An example of the first is a wisdom of a Buddha that realizes the specific, uncommon signs of all phenomena, an example of the second is a wisdom of a Buddha that realizes the specific divisions of all phenomena, an example of the third is a wisdom of a Buddha that realizes the specific etymological explanations of all phenomena and an example of the fourth is a wisdom of a Buddha that experiences inexhaustible confidence in revealing Dharma.</p>

The definition of the great <a id="calibre_link-2337"></a>joy that is a quality of a Buddha is an ultimate joy that is supremely joyful in leading all living beings to a state of happiness. The definition of the great <a id="calibre_link-2338"></a>equanimity that is a quality of a Buddha is an ultimate realization unmixed with attachment or hatred.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of an unshared quality of a Buddha is an uncommon quality of the body, speech or mind of a Buddha that is not possessed by other Superior beings. There are eighteen <a id="calibre_link-2339"></a>unshared qualities &ndash; six unshared activities, six unshared realizations, three unshared deeds and three unshared exalted awarenesses. They are called ‘unsurpassed’ because these qualities in <a id="calibre_link-2340"></a>Buddha Shakyamuni are never surpassed by others.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The six unshared activities are &ndash; not possessing mistaken activities of body, not possessing mistaken activities of speech, not possessing mistaken activities of mind, not possessing a mind not in meditative equipoise, not possessing conceptuality and not possessing neutrality. All Buddha’s bodily, verbal and mental actions are completely pure and unmistaken because they arise from the all-knowing exalted wisdom. Sometimes Hinayana <a id="calibre_link-2341"></a>Foe Destroyers and even Bodhisattvas on the <a id="calibre_link-2342"></a>three pure grounds may act mistakenly due to the imprints of delusions, but Buddhas never make mistakes. Even when they are engaged in activities of <a id="calibre_link-2343"></a>subsequent attainment such as giving teachings to others their mind remains in meditative equipoise. Only Buddhas can manifest unmistaken minds during subsequent attainment. Moreover, because their minds are completely free from conceptuality they do not need conceptual motivation to act. All their actions arise spontaneously through the force of their unobstructed great compassion. All Buddha’s actions are virtuous. Buddhas do not engage even in neutral <a id="calibre_link-2344"></a>actions, let alone in negative ones.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The six unshared realizations are &ndash; not possessing degeneration of aspiration, not possessing degeneration of effort, not possessing degeneration of mindfulness, not possessing degeneration of concentration, not possessing degeneration of wisdom and not possessing degeneration of perfect liberation. Buddhas have already accomplished their own purpose so their only aspiration is to accomplish the purpose of others. They have completed the perfection of effort and so all their actions arise naturally and spontaneously. Because their mind is a subtle <a id="calibre_link-2345"></a>mind of <a id="calibre_link-2346"></a>clear light realizing conventional truths and ultimate truth directly and simultaneously their mindfulness, concentration and wisdom never degenerate, and because they have attained true cessations of the two obstructions their experience of liberation is supreme and indestructible.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The three unshared deeds are &ndash; deeds of body preceded by and followed by exalted awareness, deeds of speech preceded by and followed by exalted awareness and deeds of mind preceded by and followed by exalted awareness. Because Buddha’s body, speech and mind are the nature of omniscient wisdom all his deeds of body, speech and mind are completely pure, unobstructed and all-pervasive. For example, <a id="calibre_link-2347"></a>Buddha’s body is not obstructed by physical forms. Wherever <a id="calibre_link-2348"></a>Buddha’s mind is his or her body is there too. Since his mind pervades all objects of knowledge so does his body. Therefore if we make prayers to Buddha we can be confident that he is immediately present. <a id="calibre_link-2349"></a>Buddha’s speech is completely free from faults such as being too loud, too soft, unclear, or unpleasant to listen to. No matter how far away the listener is, Buddha’s speech is always perfectly audible and intelligible. Just as thunder spontaneously manifests from the sky when the necessary atmospheric conditions occur, so Buddhas spontaneously give perfect teachings whenever their unobstructed wisdom and compassion meet with receptive disciples. Because Buddha’s mind is perfectly pure and unobstructed his environment and enjoyments are also pure. Thus, for example, if we offer a bowl of water to Buddha, he experiences only uncontaminated nectar.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The three unshared exalted awarenesses are &ndash; unobstructed exalted awareness that knows all the <a id="calibre_link-2350"></a>past without obstruction, unobstructed exalted awareness that knows all the future without obstruction and unobstructed exalted awareness that knows all the present without obstruction. To understand how Buddhas can know all three times directly and simultaneously we need to contemplate deeply the explanation of the three times given previously.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-2351"></a>knower of all aspects is an exalted awareness that is completely free from obstructions to omniscience and knows all aspects of all objects of knowledge directly and simultaneously. It is synonymous with <a id="calibre_link-2352"></a>omniscient mind and Wisdom Truth Body and is possessed only by Buddhas. Ordinary beings do not know all aspects of even one object, let alone all objects.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In <a id="calibre_link-2353"></a><span class="italic">Ornament for Clear Realization</span> Maitreya gives three reasons why <a id="calibre_link-2354"></a>Buddha’s mind knows all phenomena directly and simultaneously &ndash; (1) Buddhas <a id="calibre_link-2355"></a>directly realize the <a id="calibre_link-2356"></a>two truths of all phenomena because they have completed meditation on the two truths being one entity (2) Buddhas have complete knowledge of all phenomena being of one taste in the state of emptiness and (3) a Buddha’s mind is completely free from the two obstructions.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The knower of all aspects is often called the ‘Mother of Buddhas’ because it fulfils Buddha’s wishes, just as a mother fulfils the wishes of her children. Buddha’s main wish is to lead all beings to the supreme happiness of full enlightenment and he can fulfil this wish only because he possesses the knower of all aspects. Because he has attained omniscient wisdom, Buddha is able perfectly to turn the Wheel of Dharma and lead countless beings along the path to liberation and enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The root text calls the knower of all aspects ‘<a id="calibre_link-2357"></a>direct perceiver’ because it is the ultimate direct perceiver of all aspects. Others who are not Buddhas do not have this mind.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">A present thing does not remain for a second moment. Moreover, at that time the arising of past things has ceased and the arising of future things does not yet exist. Therefore, the three times do not exist together anywhere. For this reason they are said to be ‘unobservable’. Because they are not inherently constant and because they do not inherently disintegrate the three times are empty of inherent existence. The lack of inherent existence of the three times is called the ‘emptiness of the unobservable’.</p>

The emptiness of the assembling of causes and conditions is called ‘the emptiness of no thing’.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The sixteen emptinesses listed above are distinguished not in terms of their entities nor in terms of the reasoning that establishes them but in terms of the functions of the meditative concentrations that observe them. In terms of their entities they are all the same because they are all mere lack of inherent existence. Similarly in terms of the reasoning that establishes them they are not different because once we have realized one emptiness we can realize all the others through the same reasoning. The meditative concentrations that observe these sixteen emptinesses, however, perform different functions. Thus meditation on the emptiness of the inner functions to overcome true-grasping, attachment and other negative conceptions with respect to inner phenomena such as our body and meditation on the emptiness of the outer functions to overcome true-grasping, attachment and other negative conceptions with respect to outer phenomena such as our possessions. The functions of the other meditative concentrations can be understood in the same way.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">In the <span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span> Buddha uses the term ‘thing’ to indicate the five <a id="calibre_link-2360"></a>aggregates. This is because when all things are condensed they are included within the five aggregates. Thus all the objects of the five senses &ndash; forms, sounds, smells, tastes and tactile objects &ndash; are the <a id="calibre_link-2361"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-2362"></a>form; all feelings are the <a id="calibre_link-2363"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-2364"></a>feeling; all discriminations are the <a id="calibre_link-2365"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-2366"></a>discrimination; all mental factors other than feeling and discrimination such as aspiration, concentration and wisdom, as well as all persons, potentials, karmic <a id="calibre_link-2367"></a>imprints and <a id="calibre_link-2368"></a>imprints of delusions are the <a id="calibre_link-2369"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-2370"></a>compositional factors; and all primary minds are the <a id="calibre_link-2371"></a>aggregate of <a id="calibre_link-2372"></a>consciousness. Things are called ‘aggregates’ because each thing is an aggregation of parts dependent on causes and conditions. Since there is not a single thing that is not included within the aggregates, the lack of inherent existence of the five aggregates is called the ‘emptiness of things’. Buddha explained this emptiness to overcome the mind that grasps at produced phenomena as inherently existent.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-2378"></a>ultimate nature of a phenomenon is its lack of existing from its own side. Because this nature is not created anew by anyone, but has existed since beginningless time it is called ‘ultimate nature’. A <a id="calibre_link-2379"></a>pot for example does not exist from its own side and its <a id="calibre_link-2380"></a>lack of existing from its own side has existed since beginningless time. Moreover the ultimate nature of phenomena is itself empty of inherent existence. Ultimate nature’s lack of inherent existence is called the ‘emptiness of nature’. Buddha explained this <a id="calibre_link-2381"></a>emptiness to overcome the mind that grasps at the ultimate nature of phenomena as inherently existent.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE EMPTINESS OF OTHER ENTITIES</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.222] Whether Buddhas actually appear</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Or do not appear</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">The emptiness of all things</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Is explained as the other entity.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.223] The perfect end and thatness</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Are the emptiness of other entities.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">These explanations have been given</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">According to </span><span class="bold-italic">Perfection of Wisdom</span><span class="bold">.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">‘Other entity’ here means a superior phenomenon such as emptiness. Although things are created in dependence on causes and conditions their lack of inherent existence is not created by anyone. It was not created by Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, gods or any other being. Thus whether Buddhas actually appear in this world or not the lack of inherent existence of all things exists from beginningless time without being created by anyone. For this reason lack of inherent existence is thoroughly non-deceptive and superior to conventional phenomena. This is why it is called the ‘other entity’.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">In the Sutras, Buddha describes three phenomena as ‘other’ &ndash; emptiness, or thatness, because it is superior to conventional phenomena; the <a id="calibre_link-2382"></a>wisdom directly realizing emptiness because it is superior to worldly beings’ minds; and <a id="calibre_link-2383"></a>nirvana, or the perfect end, because it is superior to samsara. Since all three lack inherent existence their emptiness is called the ‘emptiness of other entities’. Buddha explained this emptiness to overcome the mind that grasps at superior phenomena as inherently existent.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">All these explanations, of the two selflessnesses, the sixteen emptinesses and the four emptinesses, have been given exactly according to Buddha’s <a id="calibre_link-2384"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span>. They have not been fabricated by Chandrakirti.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">CONCLUSION BY WAY OF EXPRESSING THE GOOD QUALITIES OF THE GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VI.224] Thus, with the rays of his wisdom he attains a clear appearance</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Goes to the supreme &ndash; the ocean of the Conquerors’ qualities.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">In summary, the Bodhisattva on the sixth ground possesses the special qualities of a surpassing <a id="calibre_link-2385"></a>perfection of wisdom. With the light rays of his wisdom he dispels all darkness obscuring emptiness and attains a clear appearance such that emptiness appears as clearly to his mind as an olive resting in the palm of his hand would appear to his eye consciousness. Realizing that the environments and the inhabitants of all <a id="calibre_link-2386"></a>three worlds &ndash; the <a id="calibre_link-2387"></a>naga world beneath, the human world above and the god world on high &ndash; have been without inherently existent production from the beginning, his mind and emptiness mix indistinguishably as one taste and he enters into the <a id="calibre_link-2388"></a>absorption of cessation. He attains this cessation through the power of <a id="calibre_link-2389"></a>nominal truth, not through the power of true existence.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">In addition to these special good qualities of wisdom, the <a id="calibre_link-2390"></a>sixth-ground Bodhisattva also possesses special good qualities of <a id="calibre_link-2391"></a>method. Even though his mind is completely pacified and constantly and single-pointedly directed towards emptiness, he nevertheless continues to increase his compassion for living beings and always strives to work for their benefit.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Bodhisattva will now advance to the <a id="calibre_link-2392"></a>seventh ground, Gone Afar, whereon his or her wisdom will surpass that of all Hearers and Solitary Realizers. In the root text it says ‘defeat’, but the meaning is ‘outshine’. Generally, Hinayana <a id="calibre_link-2393"></a>Foe Destroyers have excellent qualities of wisdom because they have realized emptiness directly and so have completely abandoned self-grasping, but their wisdom compares with that of a seventh-ground Bodhisattva as the light of a firefly compares with that of the sun. The sun has no wish to outshine fireflies, it just does so naturally. In the same way, seventh-ground Bodhisattvas have no wish to outshine Hinayana Foe Destroyers, they just do so naturally.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">In <a id="calibre_link-2394"></a><span class="italic">Birth Stories</span> there is a story about one of <a id="calibre_link-2395"></a>Buddha Shakyamuni’s previous lives when he was born as a king of geese. During this life he protected countless geese from suffering and led them to the land of happiness. Chandrakirti summarizes the sixth chapter by comparing the <a id="calibre_link-2396"></a>sixth-ground Bodhisattva to the <a id="calibre_link-2397"></a>king of the geese. His realizations of the stages of the <a id="calibre_link-2398"></a>vast and <a id="calibre_link-2399"></a>profound paths are his broad white wings of convention and thatness. Spreading these, he comes to the fore of the geese of the countless living beings who are his disciples and expounds the vast and profound Dharma to them. Finally, through the force of his powerful winds of virtue he and all his disciples go to the supreme state of Buddhahood. Implicitly this teaches that if we want to attain Buddhahood we must enter into the Mahayana path and through training on both the vast and profound paths complete the collections of merit and wisdom. Just as a bird cannot fly with only one wing, so we cannot attain Buddhahood by training in only one of these paths.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-2405"></a>Bodhisattva on the sixth ground continues to meditate on emptiness until he or she attains the uninterrupted path that is the direct antidote to small-middling <a id="calibre_link-2406"></a>innate true-grasping. This is the <a id="calibre_link-2407"></a>uninterrupted path of the sixth ground. In the next moment he attains the <a id="calibre_link-2408"></a>released path that has completely abandoned small-middling innate true-grasping. This is the first moment of the seventh ground.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DEFINITION OF THE SEVENTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of the <a id="calibre_link-2409"></a>seventh ground is a Superior Bodhisattva’s path that has abandoned small-middling innate true-grasping, its principal object of abandonment, and that has attained a surpassing practice of the perfection of skilful means from within the ten perfections.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS OF THE SEVENTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-2410"></a>seventh ground has three divisions &ndash; the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the seventh ground, the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment of the seventh ground and the exalted awareness of the seventh ground that is neither of the two. The first has three divisions &ndash; the released path of the seventh ground, the uninterrupted path of the seventh ground and the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the seventh ground that is neither of the two. The first of these occurs at the very beginning of the seventh ground and the second, which is the direct antidote to the three types of small innate true-grasping, occurs at the very end. Between these two, the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise that is neither of the two and the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment arise alternately.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ETYMOLOGY OF THE <a id="calibre_link-2411"></a>SEVENTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">In <a id="calibre_link-2412"></a><span class="italic">Ornament for Mahayana Sutras</span> it says that as a result of meditating on the paths for a very long time the seventh-ground Bodhisattva has attained the final path possessing true-grasping and gross effort; therefore the seventh ground is called ‘Gone Afar’.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITIES OF THE SEVENTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VII.1] Here, on Gone Afar, he can enter into cessation</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Instant by instant,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">And he has also attained a surpassing perfection of means.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The Bodhisattva on the seventh ground can enter into and rise from <a id="calibre_link-2413"></a>absorption of cessation, or emptiness, instant by instant. Here emptiness is called ‘cessation’ because through fixing the mind on emptiness we eventually attain the cessation of all <a id="calibre_link-2414"></a>elaborations of dualistic appearance. As explained before, when ordinary beings meditate on emptiness they do not find it difficult to rise from meditation because their minds do not completely mix with emptiness, but when <a id="calibre_link-2415"></a>Superior Bodhisattvas on the lower grounds meditate single-pointedly on emptiness they experience difficulty in rising from meditation because their minds mix with emptiness like water mixing with water. When the Bodhisattva reaches the <a id="calibre_link-2416"></a>seventh ground, however, he attains a special power of quick <a id="calibre_link-2417"></a>wisdom that enables him to enter into and rise from meditation on emptiness within one instant. Buddhas have completed the power of quick wisdom, which means that they can perform meditative equipoise on emptiness and subsequent attainment simultaneously.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Bodhisattva on the seventh ground has also attained a surpassing practice of the <a id="calibre_link-2418"></a>perfection of <a id="calibre_link-2419"></a>skilful means. Generally Bodhisattvas on the first six grounds also have the perfection of skilful means but on the seventh ground this perfection becomes surpassing, which means that it becomes completely pure. Thus the Bodhisattva on the seventh ground has more power to benefit others than Bodhisattvas on the lower grounds. The definition of perfection of skilful means is a mind maintained by bodhichitta that is skilled in the means of accomplishing the two purposes. It has two divisions &ndash; the transcending perfection of skilful means and the transcendent perfection of skilful means. The two purposes are to attain great enlightenment for oneself and to lead all other living beings to that state.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">In <span class="italic">The </span><span class="italic"><a id="calibre_link-2420"></a></span><span class="italic">Bodhisattvas’ Grounds</span> Asanga explains that there are two perfections of skilful means &ndash; the perfection of skilful means that is skilled in accomplishing all the qualities of a Buddha within oneself and the perfection of skilful means that is skilled in ripening all other living beings. The first has six parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(1)	Always looking on all living beings with compassion</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(2)	Always looking at the ultimate nature of all phenomena</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(3)	Always desiring the exalted awareness of unsurpassed enlightenment</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(4)	Always looking after living beings and never considering samsara to be the main object of abandonment</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(5)	Always taking rebirth in the abodes of samsara out of great compassion</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last">(6)	Always striving to attain Buddhahood</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The second also has six parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(1)	Causing even the smallest virtuous roots in living beings to ripen into immeasurable fruits</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(2)	Causing living beings to accomplish great roots of virtue</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(3)	Eliminating anger in those who dislike Buddha’s doctrine</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(4)	Encouraging those who are favourably disposed towards the doctrine to enter into it</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">(5)	Ripening the mental continuums of those who have entered into the doctrine</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last">(6)	Causing those who are ripened to attain liberation</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Thus, altogether there are twelve perfections of skilful means, and they are all surpassing for the Bodhisattva on the seventh ground.</p>

Between these two, the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise that is neither of the two and the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment arise alternately.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ETYMOLOGY OF THE <a id="calibre_link-2428"></a>EIGHTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Because this ground is completely free from true-grasping and all other delusions, it cannot be moved by the mind of true-grasping; therefore it is called ‘Immovable’.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">His prayers become extremely pure,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">And he is raised from cessation by the Conquerors.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Even though the Bodhisattva on the seventh ground has become a great being, nevertheless he strives repeatedly to attain the eighth ground, Immovable, because he sees that a Bodhisattva on that ground possesses virtuous qualities superior even to those of a seventh-ground Bodhisattva. In particular, he or she sees that on the <a id="calibre_link-2429"></a>eighth ground the Bodhisattva completely abandons all delusions and their seeds such that they never return.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Bodhisattva on the eighth ground attains a surpassing practice of the <a id="calibre_link-2430"></a>perfection of prayer. This means that his prayers become extremely pure and he attains a power of <a id="calibre_link-2431"></a>prayer not possessed by Bodhisattvas on the lower grounds. Although the perfection of prayer exists even on the first ground it does not become surpassing until the eighth. In <a id="calibre_link-2432"></a><span class="italic">Sutra on the Ten Grounds</span> it says that through the power of his prayer a Bodhisattva on the eighth ground can accomplish in one instant a purpose that a first-ground Bodhisattva would take a hundred thousand aeons to accomplish. The definition of perfection of prayer is a mind maintained by the bodhichitta that aspires to accomplish either of the two purposes by means of prayer. It has two divisions &ndash; the transcending perfection of prayer and the transcendent perfection of prayer.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">When the eighth-ground Bodhisattva enters meditative equipoise, he or she attains a special realization similar to the <a id="calibre_link-2433"></a>clear light of a Buddha’s <a id="calibre_link-2434"></a>Truth Body. At that time, Buddhas appear directly to him and encourage him to rise from cessation and strive to accomplish a Buddha’s <a id="calibre_link-2435"></a>Form Body to help living beings. They say to him, ‘O Son of the Lineage, it is very good that you have abandoned all delusions and attained a wisdom similar to the Truth Body, but without abandoning your practice of the Truth Body you must now rise from cessation and strive to complete the collection of merit to attain a Buddha’s Form Body.’ In this way he is raised from cessation by the Conquerors.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">SHOWING THAT HE HAS EXTINGUISHED ALL DELUSIONS</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VIII.2] Because his mind of non-attachment does not remain with faults</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">He cannot yet attain all the qualities of the Buddhas, which are as endless as space.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The previous verse explained how the Bodhisattva on the eighth ground has qualities of realization superior to those of the Bodhisattva on the seventh ground. The present verse now explains how he or she also possesses superior qualities of abandonment. Because his exalted awareness is completely free from the faults of the delusions, the eighth-grounder has thoroughly abandoned all delusions together with their roots. However, even though his delusions are extinguished and he is the highest being in the three realms he cannot yet attain all the qualities of the Buddhas, which are as endless as space. Therefore he strives to advance to higher grounds.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">SHOWING THAT HE HAS ATTAINED THE <a id="calibre_link-2436"></a>TEN POWERS</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[VIII.3] Although samsara has ceased, he attains the ten powers,</span></p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Since the <a id="calibre_link-2437"></a>Bodhisattva on the eighth ground has abandoned all delusions the continuum of samsara has ceased for him and it is not possible for him to take <a id="calibre_link-2438"></a>rebirth in samsara without choice. However, to benefit living beings and to complete the remaining paths he or she displays the aspect of various beings within samsara. These forms, which are in essence the nature of his mind, arise purely in dependence on uncontaminated <a id="calibre_link-2439"></a>actions. The Bodhisattva is able to display these forms because on the eighth ground he attains the ten powers. These are:</p>

			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	The force of intention</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of the <a id="calibre_link-2456"></a>tenth ground is a Superior Bodhisattva’s path that has abandoned the three types of middling obstruction to omniscience, its principal objects of abandonment, and that has attained a surpassing practice of the perfection of exalted awareness from within the ten perfections.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS OF THE TENTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The <a id="calibre_link-2457"></a>tenth ground has three divisions &ndash; the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise of the tenth ground, the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment of the tenth ground and the exalted awareness of the tenth ground that is neither of the two.

The first of these occurs at the very beginning of the tenth ground and the second, which is the direct antidote to the three types of small obstruction to omniscience, occurs at the very end. The uninterrupted path of the tenth ground is called the ‘<a id="calibre_link-2458"></a>vajra-like concentration of the path of meditation’ because it mixes with emptiness like water mixing with water and since in the next moment one becomes a Buddha it is never again separated from emptiness. This mind is also called the ‘<a id="calibre_link-2459"></a>exalted awareness of the final continuum’ because it is the final moment of the mental continuum of a <a id="calibre_link-2460"></a>sentient being. Between the released path of the tenth ground and the uninterrupted path of the tenth ground, the exalted awareness of meditative equipoise that is neither of the two and the exalted awareness of subsequent attainment arise alternately.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ETYMOLOGY OF THE <a id="calibre_link-2461"></a>TENTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Within the sky-like mind of the tenth-ground Bodhisattva clouds of realizations such as compassion, wisdom and concentration send down a rain of Dharma to ripen the virtuous crops of living beings; therefore this ground is called ‘Cloud of Dharma’.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITIES OF THE TENTH GROUND</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[X.1] On the tenth ground, he receives holy empowerments from Buddhas in all directions,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And he also attains a supreme, surpassing exalted awareness.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Just as rain falls from rain clouds, so for the sake of living beings’ virtuous crops</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">A rain of Dharma spontaneously falls from the Conquerors’ Son.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The Bodhisattva on the <a id="calibre_link-2462"></a>tenth ground manifests a million minds of concentration and receives holy empowerments from all the Buddhas in the ten directions. Buddhas from all the Buddha Lands of the ten directions appear before him or her and radiate light from the hair curl at their foreheads. This light enters the Bodhisattva’s body through his crown and he receives all their blessings. This is called the ‘<a id="calibre_link-2463"></a>empowerment of great light’. They then proclaim, ‘You are like an actual Buddha’ and honour him or her as a Buddha. In the Sutras it says that a Bodhisattva on the eighth ground is like a prince, a Bodhisattva on the ninth ground like a regent and a Bodhisattva on the tenth ground like an actual <a id="calibre_link-2464"></a>king. This indicates that although the tenth-ground Bodhisattva is not yet an actual Buddha he or she possesses qualities similar to those of a Buddha.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Bodhisattva on the tenth ground also attains a surpassing perfection of exalted awareness because he or she attains a special wisdom that correctly knows the signs of all phenomena. Although Bodhisattvas on the lower grounds also have the perfection of exalted awareness theirs does not possess the power of the tenth-ground Bodhisattva’s. The definition of perfection of exalted awareness is a mind maintained by bodhichitta that knows the conventional nature of all phenomena through its own power. It has two divisions &ndash; the transcending perfection of exalted awareness and the transcendent perfection of exalted awareness.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The sixth perfection, the <a id="calibre_link-2465"></a>perfection of wisdom, principally realizes the ultimate nature of phenomena, whereas the tenth perfection, the <a id="calibre_link-2466"></a>perfection of exalted awareness, principally realizes their conventional nature. Otherwise they are the same because they are both perfections of wisdom. Within the ten <a id="calibre_link-2467"></a>perfections the last four are principally induced by wisdom and they are all included within the perfection of wisdom. Thus there is no contradiction in saying that all the trainings of a Bodhisattva are included within six <a id="calibre_link-2468"></a>perfections.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The tenth-ground Bodhisattva also engages in the practice of benefiting other living beings by bestowing on them a rain of Dharma. Just as, without conception and without effort, rain falls from rain clouds and sustains crops on the earth, so for the sake of living beings’ virtuous crops, without any conceptual exertion a rain of Dharma spontaneously falls from the clouds of compassion, wisdom and so forth in the sky-like mind of this Conquerors’ Son. In this way, countless living beings will be liberated from the sufferings of samsara.</p>

			<p class="text-heading">THE GOOD QUALITIES OF THE THREE PURE GROUNDS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">The first seven grounds are called the ‘seven impure grounds’ because the Bodhisattvas who abide on them have not yet abandoned delusion-obstructions, and the last three grounds are called the ‘<a id="calibre_link-2482"></a>three pure grounds’ because the Bodhisattvas who abide on them have abandoned delusion-obstructions. However, Bodhisattvas on the three pure grounds have not yet abandoned obstructions to omniscience. The good qualities attained by the Bodhisattvas on the three pure grounds are explained in the next four verses.</p>

For example, in one instant he or she can see as many Buddhas as there are atoms in a hundred thousand of the three thousand worlds. The magnitude of the three thousand worlds is explained as follows. Our world, the <a id="calibre_link-2484"></a>Unforgetting World, consists of <a id="calibre_link-2485"></a>Mount Meru surrounded by the four continents and their sub-continents. A thousand of these worlds is called the ‘thousand worlds’, a thousand of these is called the ‘two thousand worlds’ and a thousand of these is called the ‘three thousand worlds’. If we multiply these by a hundred thousand and then try to imagine how many atoms these worlds contain &ndash; that is the number of Buddhas seen in one instant by the Bodhisattva on the eighth ground.

			<p class="text-1st-para">The tenth ground can be explained only briefly because its qualities have passed beyond what can be expressed in words, there being as many of these twelve qualities as there are atoms in the inexpressible number of Buddha Lands. Moment by moment this <a id="calibre_link-2487"></a>Bodhisattva can display in his or her pores the bodies of perfect Buddhas beyond number together with their retinues of countless Bodhisattvas. Likewise, he is able to display in his pores gods, demi-gods, Brahmas, Indras, protectors of the world, humans, Hearers, Solitary Realizers and many other different aspects of living beings, all in an instant. These and all the other good qualities of the tenth-ground Bodhisattva are explained extensively in <a id="calibre_link-2488"></a><span class="italic">Sutra on the Ten Grounds</span>.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">When we first hear of the special qualities of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas we may find them incredible and we may even doubt that it is possible for anyone to possess such qualities. This is because at present our mind is largely undeveloped. Trying to comprehend the qualities of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with our present mind is like trying to reflect an image of the whole of space within a small mirror. As our mind develops, however, our mental capacity will expand and we will become more like these high beings. Then we will be able more easily to understand their special qualities.</p>

Buddha Shakyamuni, for example, first generated bodhichitta and then trained on the Mahayana paths until he reached the ninth ground. Then he strove again for the exalted awareness of the final continuum of the tenth ground. This realization, the vajra-like concentration of the path of meditation, is the direct cause of the ten <a id="calibre_link-2494"></a>forces, the unsurpassed qualities of a <a id="calibre_link-2495"></a>Buddha. It is like a moon in a clear autumn sky. Just as a moon in a clear sky dispels all darkness and illuminates clearly all forms, in the same way the <a id="calibre_link-2496"></a>exalted awareness of the final continuum dispels all darkness of the <a id="calibre_link-2497"></a>obstructions to omniscience and causes the body of a Buddha to appear clearly.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-2498"></a>Buddha Shakyamuni accomplished the aim for which he strove &ndash; all those unequalled, ultimate good qualities of the supreme state of Buddhahood &ndash; in the Pure Land of <a id="calibre_link-2499"></a>Akanishta. In just the same way, all other beings who have become Buddhas have first generated bodhichitta then trained on the Mahayana paths until they attained the <a id="calibre_link-2500"></a>exalted awareness of the final continuum and then attained enlightenment in the Pure Land of Akanishta. This is explained in many <a id="calibre_link-2501"></a>Mahayana Sutras. According to the lower schools such as the <a id="calibre_link-2502"></a>Vaibhashikas, Buddha Shakyamuni attained enlightenment in <a id="calibre_link-2503"></a>Bodh Gaya in India. In reality, however, he attained <a id="calibre_link-2504"></a>enlightenment in Akanishta many aeons before he appeared in this world. He merely displayed the manner of attaining enlightenment at Bodh Gaya to show the beings of this world that it is possible to accomplish such great results through practising Dharma.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">When Buddha Shakyamuni first attained enlightenment in Akanishta he directly realized all objects of knowledge in an instant. He could do this because previously with the <a id="calibre_link-2505"></a>vajra-like concentration of the path of meditation he had abandoned all obstructions to omniscience. Although there are countless conventional phenomena, each with a different entity, all emptinesses are the same entity. For example, even though there are many vessels in this world that enclose space, <a id="calibre_link-2506"></a>space itself does not have separate divisions because all space is the same entity &ndash; mere lack of obstructive contact. In the same way, even though there are many different objects in this world, emptiness does not have separate divisions because all <a id="calibre_link-2507"></a>emptinesses are the same entity &ndash; mere lack of inherent existence. Thus, because Buddha Shakyamuni perfectly realizes all phenomena as of one taste in emptiness he directly realizes all phenomena in one instant.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">You say emptiness is mere lack of inherent existence. If that is the case wisdom cannot apprehend it because there is no uncommon sign for a knower to discriminate and so there is no object for the mind to apprehend. If the mind does not engage in an object there is no object-possessor of emptiness. It makes no sense to call a mind an object-possessor realizing an object of knowledge if it does not apprehend an object. Furthermore, how can that mind be a knower if it does not know anything? That is a contradiction. If there is no knower realizing emptiness there is no person realizing emptiness, so how can you teach others, ‘Emptiness is like this’ and so on? In short, it is not suitable to assert either a knower realizing emptiness or a person realizing emptiness.</p>

Since Buddha’s mind apprehends unmistakenly the aspect of the mere absence of inherently existent production, by apprehending that aspect it realizes thatness. Even according to your system, when a mind apprehends any aspect such as blue you say that that mind knows its object thoroughly. In just the same way, in our system because Buddha’s mind apprehends an aspect of thatness it knows thatness by realizing this nominality. Thus we can establish a knower of thatness and we do not incur the first fault, that there is no mind that knows emptiness.</p>

Through the power of this merit sounds that reveal the Dharma of thatness arise from his two bodies even though he has no conceptual motivation. These teachings are heard by Hearers, Solitary Realizers, Bodhisattvas and so forth and as a result these beings also realize thatness. There are many examples of teachings arising from objects that lack conceptual motivation. For example, in the story of the Bodhisattva <a id="calibre_link-2516"></a>Sadaprarudita told at the end of the <a id="calibre_link-2517"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in Eight Thousand Lines</span> it explains how he heard teachings arising from space.

			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">It is one of the extraordinary qualities of Buddha that he can benefit countless living beings while his mind abides immovably as the <a id="calibre_link-2520"></a>Truth Body, or Dharmakaya. Even though he lacks the direct generation of a motivation, nevertheless countless beings will receive benefit from his deeds of expounding Dharma. If you wonder how it is possible for Buddha to work for the benefit of others without a conceptual motivation you should consider the following <a id="calibre_link-2521"></a>analogy. A potter first expends much energy turning the wheel and then when he stops applying effort the wheel continues to turn,and functions as a cause of a pot. In the same way, through the strength of his practice while training in previous lives on the Mahayana paths, Buddha put great effort into completing the two collections of merit and wisdom and although he no longer expends effort nevertheless he continues to turn the Wheel of Dharma and benefit countless living beings. Thus, Buddha resides in the Truth Body and engages in deeds of teaching Dharma and so forth that are completely beyond thought without generating any effort. He can do this because of the special qualities of his prayers made while training on the paths and the ripening of virtuous seeds of liberation in the minds of living beings.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.17] That pacification that comes from the burning of all the dry tinder of objects of knowledge</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Is the </span><span class="bold"><a id="calibre_link-2522"></a></span><span class="bold">Truth Body of the Conquerors.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">At that time there is no production and no disintegration.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Since minds have ceased, it is experienced directly by the body.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-2523"></a>Truth Body is the emptiness of the mind or the mind itself completely purified of all obstructions to omniscience. Here, ‘dry tinder of objects of knowledge’ means the obstructions to omniscience and ‘burning’ means abandoning. There are two types of Truth Body &ndash; Wisdom Truth Body and Nature Truth Body. The Wisdom <a id="calibre_link-2524"></a>Truth Body is the mind of a Buddha mixed inseparably with emptiness. Because a Buddha’s mind is completely mixed with emptiness like water mixed with water, and because his mind never moves from that state, all his minds are the Wisdom Truth Body. When, prior to attaining Buddhahood, we attain a direct realization of emptiness and our mind mixes with emptiness like water mixing with water we attain a similitude of the Wisdom Truth Body. This is only a temporary state, and sooner or later the mind moves and separates from emptiness. A Buddha’s mind, however, never separates from emptiness. Therefore only Buddhas possess the actual Wisdom Truth Body.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Nature Truth Body is the emptiness of Buddha’s mind that possesses two purities &ndash; the purity that is the absence of inherent existence from the very beginning and the purity that is freedom from the two obstructions. We all have two <a id="calibre_link-2525"></a>Buddha natures &ndash; the naturally abiding Buddha nature and the increasing Buddha nature. The first is the emptiness of our very subtle mind, which will become the Nature <a id="calibre_link-2526"></a>Truth Body of a Buddha when we become a Buddha. The second is our very subtle <a id="calibre_link-2527"></a>mind itself. Through our increasing the qualities of this mind eventually it will become the Wisdom <a id="calibre_link-2528"></a>Truth Body of a Buddha.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">How is the Truth Body attained? Through training on the Mahayana paths a Yogi or Yogini eventually attains the <a id="calibre_link-2529"></a>exalted awareness of the final continuum, which is the last moment of the path of meditation. This concentration functions as the direct antidote to the three types of small <a id="calibre_link-2530"></a>obstruction to omniscience. In the next moment, he or she attains the <a id="calibre_link-2531"></a>released path that has completely abandoned all obstructions. This is the first moment of Buddhahood. Simultaneously, his or her mind becomes the Wisdom Truth Body, the emptiness of his or her mind becomes the Nature Truth Body and his or her subtle form body becomes the <a id="calibre_link-2532"></a>Enjoyment Body.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">His Nature Truth Body, which is his main body, has no production or disintegration. Moreover, at that time all conceptual minds have ceased. Therefore the Nature Truth Body is first directly experienced by the body of non-conceptual wisdom. Some interpret the last line of this verse to mean that because Buddha has no mind, the Truth Body is experienced by his body, but this is not correct. It is absurd to suggest that a Buddha has no mind.</p>

Since the Truth Body can be seen only by Buddhas and the Enjoyment Body only by Superior Bodhisattvas, the Enjoyment Body manifests countless Emanation Bodies that can be seen by ordinary beings. For example, the <a id="calibre_link-2540"></a>Enjoyment Body <a id="calibre_link-2541"></a>Munivairochana manifested a hundred million Emanation Bodies of <a id="calibre_link-2542"></a>Buddha Shakyamuni in a hundred million different worlds.

Buddha Shakyamuni, the Powerful Able One who appears in a Form Body corresponding to its cause, the Enjoyment Body of Munivairochana, can make a complete and exquisite display of everything that happened during his previous lives in one tiny pore of his body. He can display clearly and in the correct order all his places of rebirth since beginningless time and all his bodies, friends, relatives and enjoyments that have now ceased.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">When he was a Bodhisattva training on the paths he made offerings to countless Buddhas in countless Buddha Lands. He can display all these in one pore of his present body.

Furthermore he can show how many assemblies of Hearers there were there and what they were like, how many Bodhisattvas there were there and what forms they took, what good qualities they had, what kind of Dharma was expounded to the various assemblies of Hearers and Bodhisattvas, what forms he himself took, sometimes as a Brahmin, sometimes as a monk, sometimes as a lay person and so forth, what deeds the Bodhisattvas performed after listening to Dharma and what kind of giving he practised when making offerings to the Buddhas.

He can also display all their deeds from first generating bodhichitta through to attaining the essence of enlightenment.

			<p class="text-heading">AN EXTENSIVE EXPLANATION</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Each of the ten forces will now be explained.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE FORCE KNOWING SOURCE AND NON-SOURCE</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.31] Any cause from which something is definitely produced</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Is said by the Omniscient Ones to be the source of that.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">The opposite of what is explained is not a source.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">The knower of infinite objects of knowledge that has abandoned obstructions is said to be a force.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Buddha said that any <a id="calibre_link-2548"></a>cause from which an effect is produced is the source of that effect. For example, a seed from which a sprout is produced is the source of that sprout. Thus all causes are the sources of their effects. For example, <a id="calibre_link-2549"></a>virtuous actions are the source of happiness and <a id="calibre_link-2550"></a>non-virtuous actions are the source of <a id="calibre_link-2551"></a>suffering. On the other hand, wheat seeds, for example, are not the source of rice, non-virtuous actions are not the source of happiness and virtuous actions are not the source of suffering. Because ordinary beings do not know the sources of happiness they engage in actions that increase their suffering instead of increasing their happiness, and because they do not know the sources of suffering they continually create the causes of suffering for themselves even though they have no wish to suffer. Therefore it is essential to know what is a source and what is not a source. The definition of a force that is a Buddha’s mind knowing source and non-source is an exalted awareness that has abandoned all obstructions and that knows directly the infinite objects of knowledge that are source and non-source.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE FORCE KNOWING FULL RIPENING OF ACTIONS</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.32] The desirable, the undesirable, the reverse of these, actions of abandonment</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">That encompasses objects of knowledge of the three times is said to be a force.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">There are countless <a id="calibre_link-2552"></a>actions, such as virtuous actions, non-virtuous actions, actions that are a mixture of virtue and non-virtue and uncontaminated <a id="calibre_link-2553"></a>actions that have abandoned non-virtue. Similarly, there is a great variety of effects of actions such as fully-ripened effects, environmental effects, effects similar to the cause and bodies of the nature of mind that are effects of uncontaminated actions. Only a Buddha can directly understand all gross and subtle actions and their effects. The definition of a force that is a Buddha’s mind knowing full ripening of actions is a powerful, able, unobstructed exalted awareness that encompasses all objects of knowledge that are gross and subtle actions and effects of the three times and knows them directly and individually.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE FORCE KNOWING THE VARIOUS DESIRES</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.33] Desires arising through the force of attachment and so forth </span><span class="bold">&ndash;</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">A great variety of inferior, middling and especially superior desires </span><span class="bold">&ndash;</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Encompassing all living beings of the three times, is known as a ‘force’.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Living beings have many <a id="calibre_link-2554"></a>desires &ndash; desires that arise through the force of delusions such as attachment and hatred, desires that arise through the force of virtuous minds such as faith and compassion, desires that arise through the force of imprints in the mind and many others. Just one living being has countless desires. Some desires are inferior, others middling and others superior. Inferior desires are non-virtuous desires such as the wish to kill or steal. Middling desires are neutral desires such as the wish to eat or sleep. Superior desires are virtuous desires such as the wish to attain enlightenment, the wish to attain liberation or the wish to protect living beings. These arise through the force of Buddha’s blessings, through listening to correct teachings, through contemplation and meditation or through the force of virtuous imprints. Since desire is an internal, mental phenomenon it is difficult for an ordinary being to know others’ desires. Only a Buddha knows all the desires of living beings directly. The definition of a force that is a Buddha’s mind knowing the various desires is an unobstructed exalted awareness that encompasses all objects of knowledge that are the inferior, middling and superior desires of all living beings of the three times and knows them directly.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE FORCE KNOWING THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.34] Through their skill in perfectly distinguishing the elements</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">Realizing the distinctions of all types of element is said to be a force.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">There are many divisions of <a id="calibre_link-2555"></a>elements such as the six powers, the eye sense power and so forth; the six objects, forms and so forth; and the six consciousnesses, eye consciousness and so forth. These and their ultimate nature, emptiness, have all been explained by the Buddhas. The divisions of all the gross and subtle elements are countless and only Buddhas can know them all directly. The definition of a force that is a Buddha’s mind knowing the various elements is an unobstructed exalted awareness that knows directly all objects of knowledge that are gross and subtle elements.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE FORCE KNOWING SUPREME AND NON-SUPREME POWERS</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.35] Of conceptualization and so forth only the very sharp are accepted as supreme,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Middling types and the dull being explained as non-supreme.</span></p>

			<p class="text-1st-para">Both supreme and non-supreme <a id="calibre_link-2556"></a>powers can be classified either from the point of view of minds or from the point of view of persons. Among minds, those such as faith and wisdom are supreme powers because they are the powers that prevent delusions, whereas conceptualizations such as <a id="calibre_link-2557"></a>inappropriate attention are inferior powers because they are the powers that generate delusions. Among persons there are some who have very sharp powers, some who have middling powers and some who have dull powers; and only those with very sharp powers are accepted as supreme.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">From another point of view there are twenty-two types of power:</p>

			<p class="text-list-10-to-99-with-parenthesis-end">(22)	The power that possesses all knowledge</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The first six are powers that produce their own consciousnesses, the seventh is the power that sustains life, the eighth is the power that determines a person as male, the ninth is the power that determines a person as female, the tenth, which is bodily feeling and the eleventh, which is mental feeling, are the powers that generate attachment in ordinary beings, the twelfth, which is bodily feeling, and the thirteenth, which is mental feeling, are the powers that generate hatred in ordinary beings, the fourteenth is the power that generates confusion in ordinary beings, the fifteenth through to the nineteenth are the powers that generate the path of seeing, the twentieth, which is the path of seeing, is the power that generates the path of meditation, the twenty-first, which is the path of meditation, is the power that generates the Path of No More Learning, and the last, which is the Path of No More Learning, is the power that generates a nirvana without remainder. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Of these twenty-two powers, the first fourteen are inferior, or non-supreme, because they are causes of samsara and the last eight are supreme because they are causes of liberation and enlightenment. These are explained extensively in the commentaries to <a id="calibre_link-2558"></a><span class="italic">Treasury of Abhidharma</span> by Vasubandhu. Only Buddhas can know directly all the powers such as the eye sense power as well as their ability to support each other. The definition of a force that is a Buddha’s mind knowing supreme and non-supreme powers is an unobstructed exalted awareness that knows directly all objects of knowledge that are gross and subtle supreme and non-supreme powers.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE FORCE KNOWING ALL PATHS GOING EVERYWHERE</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.36] Some paths lead to the very state of a Conqueror,</span></p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">In general there are two types of path &ndash; external paths and internal paths. The paths that concern the spiritual practitioner are internal paths and these are more difficult to understand. Internal paths are either correct or incorrect. Correct internal paths lead to liberation or enlightenment. Some, such as the five <a id="calibre_link-2559"></a>Mahayana paths, lead to great enlightenment or Buddhahood and some, such as the five <a id="calibre_link-2560"></a>Hinayana paths, lead to the enlightenment of a Solitary Realizer or the enlightenment of a Hearer. Incorrect internal paths on the other hand lead not to liberation but to samsara. Some, such as the <a id="calibre_link-2561"></a>ten <a id="calibre_link-2562"></a>non-virtuous actions, lead to the <a id="calibre_link-2563"></a>hell realms, the <a id="calibre_link-2564"></a>hungry ghost realms, or the <a id="calibre_link-2565"></a>animal realms, and some, such as contaminated <a id="calibre_link-2566"></a>virtuous actions lead to the god realms or the human realms. Since there are so many different paths only a Buddha can know them all directly. The definition of a force that is a Buddha’s mind knowing all paths going everywhere is an unobstructed exalted awareness free from attachment that knows directly all correct and incorrect paths.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">There are many different types of <a id="calibre_link-2567"></a>Yogi and Yogini throughout limitless worlds, each of whom has attained different meditative concentrations such as the four mental stabilizations, the eight concentrations of perfect liberation, the various concentrations that are tranquil abidings and the absorptions of the nine successive abidings. Since there are countless different concentrations, some of which are mundane and some of which are supramundane, only a Buddha can know them all directly. The definition of a force that is a Buddha’s mind knowing the different mental stabilizations, concentrations of perfect liberation, concentrations of desire realm beings, absorptions and so forth is an unobstructed exalted awareness that knows directly all mundane and supramundane concentrations.</p>

Only a Buddha can know all these directly. The definition of a force that is a mind of a Buddha knowing recollections of previous lives is an unobstructed exalted awareness that knows directly all objects of knowledge that are the previous places of birth and so forth of oneself and all other living beings.</p>

Each and every living being experiences uncontrolled <a id="calibre_link-2572"></a>death and birth one after the other without cessation as the effects of their accumulated actions. However, ordinary beings do not know how or where they died in the past, how or where they were born in the past, how or where they will die in this life or how and where they will be born and die in future lives. The many varieties of death and birth of each and every living being can be known directly only by a Buddha. The definition of a force that is a Buddha’s mind knowing death and birth is an unobstructed exalted awareness that is free from attachment and completely pure and that knows directly and at one time all aspects of the process of death and birth of every living being.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">THE FORCE KNOWING THE CESSATION OF CONTAMINATIONS</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">The limitless knower of these that is free from attachment is said to be a force.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">There are three types of <a id="calibre_link-2573"></a><a id="calibre_link-2574"></a><a id="calibre_link-2575"></a>enlightenment &ndash; great, middling and small. Buddhas attain a great enlightenment by abandoning all delusions together with their imprints, Solitary Realizers attain a middling enlightenment by abandoning all delusions and Hearers attain a small enlightenment also by abandoning all delusions. Each of these three enlightenments is known as a ‘cessation of contaminations’. Only a Buddha knows all these directly and reveals them to disciples. The definition of a force that is a Buddha’s mind knowing the cessation of contaminations is an unobstructed knower free from attachment that knows directly all objects of knowledge that are <a id="calibre_link-2576"></a>cessations of contaminations.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">In the foregoing definitions, ‘free from attachment’ means ‘free from the delusion-obstructions’ and ‘unobstructed’ means ‘free from the obstructions to omniscience’. <a id="calibre_link-2577"></a>Delusion-obstructions are obstructions that principally obstruct the attainment of liberation. There are two types &ndash; manifest and non-manifest. The former are actual delusions and the latter are seeds of delusion. Delusion-obstructions can also be divided into intellectually-formed and innate. <a id="calibre_link-2578"></a>Intellectually-formed delusions are generated in dependence on incorrect reasoning or incomplete analysis. For example, the minds of proponents of non-Buddhist or lower Buddhist tenets that hold to inherently existent phenomena are intellectually-formed delusions. <a id="calibre_link-2579"></a>Innate delusions, on the other hand arise naturally from potentialities in the mind without depending on reasoning. All the delusions in the minds of <a id="calibre_link-2580"></a>animals and insects and most of the delusions in the minds of human beings are innate delusions. All intellectually-formed delusions and their seeds are abandoned by the path of seeing and all innate delusions and their seeds are abandoned by the path of meditation. Sometimes<a id="calibre_link-2581"></a> delusion-obstructions are divided into objects abandoned by the path of seeing and objects abandoned by the path of meditation. According to this system, intellectually-formed delusion-obstructions are objects abandoned by the path of seeing and innate delusion-obstructions are objects abandoned by the path of meditation.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para"><a id="calibre_link-2582"></a><a id="calibre_link-2583"></a>Obstructions to omniscience are obstructions that principally obstruct the attainment of Buddhahood. They are so called because they obstruct simultaneous and direct knowledge of all phenomena. They are of two types &ndash; manifest and non-manifest, the latter being further divided into gross and subtle. A Bodhisattva begins to abandon <a id="calibre_link-2584"></a>obstructions to omniscience on the eighth ground but they are not finally abandoned until Buddhahood is attained. A Bodhisattva on the eighth ground has abandoned all delusions and their seeds but he still has the imprints of delusions in his mental continuum, rather as wet sand will retain a footprint even after the foot has moved on. These imprints of the delusions are obstructions to omniscience. They are not to be confused with the<a id="calibre_link-2585"></a> seeds of delusion. Seeds of delusion are causes of delusion and a <a id="calibre_link-2586"></a>Bodhisattva on the eighth ground has completely abandoned these. Imprints of delusion are effects of delusion but not causes of delusion. They are, however, causes of <a id="calibre_link-2587"></a>mistaken <a id="calibre_link-2588"></a>appearance. Thus although a Bodhisattva on the eighth ground has completely abandoned true-grasping and its seeds, the imprints of true-grasping that remain cause phenomena to <a id="calibre_link-2589"></a>appear as truly existent to his or her mind. These obstructions remain until Buddhahood is attained.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Only Buddhas are free from the <a id="calibre_link-2590"></a>imprints of delusion and the mistaken appearance of true existence to which they give rise. Hinayana <a id="calibre_link-2591"></a>Foe Destroyers still have the imprints of delusion even though they have abandoned all delusions and their seeds. There are many cases of Hinayana Foe Destroyers who manifest symptoms of anger or desirous attachment through the force of these imprints. Even though they have abandoned all delusions they occasionally manifest partiality because the imprints of desirous attachment and anger remain in their mental continuums. Similarly, although they have no true-grasping, phenomena still appear to their minds as truly existent through the force of the imprints of true-grasping that remain in their minds.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The above description of Buddha’s good qualities is not exhaustive. In fact, it is impossible ever to finish describing the good qualities of a Buddha. For example, just as a bird flying in the sky does not turn back because it has run out of space but returns when its strength is consumed, so when Buddha’s Hinayana and Mahayana disciples describe the good qualities of a Buddha they stop not because they have described them all, for they are as limitless as space, but because the strength of their wisdom is consumed. Thus Chandrakirti humbly confesses, ‘How could one such as I understand or explain Buddha’s qualities?’ Nevertheless he continues, ‘Since they were explained by Superior Nagarjuna and have not been made up by me I have overcome my apprehension and mentioned just a few.’</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Even though the good qualities of <a id="calibre_link-2592"></a>Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are endless they are all included in two types &ndash; the good qualities of the <a id="calibre_link-2593"></a>profound and the good qualities of the <a id="calibre_link-2594"></a>vast. The good qualities of the profound are the wisdom realizing emptiness, the Truth Body and so forth, and the good qualities of the vast are all the other good qualities such as the ten grounds, the ten forces and the Form Body. If we understand the good qualities of the profound and the vast we will practise the stages of these two paths and eventually we will attain all these good qualities ourself.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">EXPLAINING <a id="calibre_link-2595"></a>EMANATION BODIES</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.44] You who possess an immovable Body visit the three worlds again with your Emanations</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And show descent, birth, enlightenment and the wheel of peace.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">In this way, out of compassion, you lead to a state beyond sorrow</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">All worldly beings who have deceitful behaviour and who are bound by the many nooses of attachment.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">It may be thought that whereas the Truth Body and the <a id="calibre_link-2596"></a>Enjoyment Body remain forever working for the benefit of living beings until samsara has ceased, the Emanation Bodies do not. To dispel such doubts Chandrakirti addresses the Enjoyment Body thus: ‘You who have attained an immovable Truth Body have manifested countless <a id="calibre_link-2597"></a>Emanation Bodies in the past and you will visit the three worlds again and again to display the twelve principal deeds &ndash; descent from Joyful Land, conception in a mother‘s womb, birth, mastery of the youthful skills and sports, enjoying a partner and retinue, ordination, the practice of asceticism, meditation beneath the Bodhi Tree, overcoming the demons, attaining enlightenment, turning the Wheel of Dharma and showing the manner of passing away. Your emanations will show these <a id="calibre_link-2598"></a>twelve deeds continuously, for as each emanation shows the manner of passing away in one world, it immediately shows descent into another. Out of compassion for all worldly beings who have deceitful behaviour and who are bound to samsara by the many nooses of attachment you display countless emanations to lead them temporarily to the happiness of humans and gods and finally to a state beyond sorrow.’</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Here, ‘state beyond sorrow’ means liberation from the delusions, or nirvana. Thus, ‘sorrow’ means the delusions and ‘beyond’ means liberation. Generally there are two types of <a id="calibre_link-2599"></a><a id="calibre_link-2600"></a>nirvana &ndash; a Hinayana liberation, which is the abandonment of only the delusion-obstructions and a Mahayana enlightenment, which is the abandonment of both the delusion-obstructions and the obstructions to omniscience. From another point of view there are three types of nirvana &ndash; <a id="calibre_link-2601"></a>nirvana with remainder, <a id="calibre_link-2602"></a>nirvana without remainder and non-abiding <a id="calibre_link-2603"></a>nirvana. The first two are possessed by Hinayanists. When a Hinayanist initially attains liberation he still possesses a body arisen from contaminated karma, which is a ‘remainder’ of samsara and so his true cessations at this time are called a ‘nirvana with remainder’. When he dies he is reborn in a Pure Land and takes on a pure body produced from uncontaminated causes. His true cessations are now a nirvana without remainder. The third type of nirvana is attained only by Bodhisattvas on the <a id="calibre_link-2604"></a>pure grounds and by Buddhas. It is a state of not abiding in either the extreme of samsara or the extreme of solitary peace. The supreme non-abiding nirvana is possessed only by Buddhas, who have attained true cessations of all obstructions.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">PROVING THAT THERE IS ONE <a id="calibre_link-2605"></a>FINAL VEHICLE</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.45] Because, here, apart from understanding thatness, there is no principal eliminator of all stains,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Because phenomena do not depend on different types of thatness</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And because there are not different wisdoms that are the object-possessors of thatness</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">You revealed to living beings an unequalled and undivided vehicle.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.46] Because there are these impurities that give rise to faults in living beings</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">The worldly cannot engage in the extremely profound object experienced by Buddhas.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Therefore O Sugata, since you possess both wisdom and the methods of compassion,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">And since you have promised, ‘I will liberate living beings’,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.47] Just like the skilful one travelling to a jewel island</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Who relieved the fatigue of his company by emanating a beautiful city on the way,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">You presented this vehicle to the minds of disciples as a means of peace;</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">But you taught separately those who have attained isolation and trained minds.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Question</span> Previously you said that the Enjoyment Bodies and the Emanation Bodies will ultimately lead all living beings to great complete enlightenment. Does this mean that there is only one final vehicle, the Mahayana, or Great Vehicle, and that the <a id="calibre_link-2606"></a>Hinayana, or Lesser Vehicle, is only a temporary vehicle?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> Yes it does. There are three reasons why there is only one final vehicle:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(1)	Apart from the wisdom realizing emptiness there is no direct antidote that can remove the stains of the two obstructions.</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-middle">(2)	Phenomena do not depend on different types of emptiness because there are not different types of emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-with-parenthesis-last">(3)	There are not different wisdoms that realize emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">Through these reasons we can know that the natural <a id="calibre_link-2607"></a>Buddha lineage of all living beings does not have different types and that they are all the same nature. Therefore there is no reason why all living beings will not finally attain the full enlightenment of Buddhahood. This is why Buddha Shakyamuni revealed to living beings only one final vehicle, which surpasses all other vehicles and is undivided in any way.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Objection</span> In some Sutras, Buddha says that there are three <a id="calibre_link-2608"></a>final vehicles &ndash; the Hearers’ Vehicle, the Solitary Realizers’ Vehicle and the Great Vehicle. If it is Buddha’s intention that there is only one final vehicle, the Great Vehicle, why did he mention the other two?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para"><span class="italic">Reply</span> These present times are characterized by <a id="calibre_link-2609"></a>five impurities &ndash; the impurity of time, the impurity of living beings, the impurity of view, the impurity of delusions and the impurity of life span. These give rise to many faults in living beings and as a result they cannot easily engage in the profound final vehicle, which is the only object experienced by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Therefore, since Buddha is endowed with special qualities of both wisdom and <a id="calibre_link-2610"></a>method, and since when he was a Bodhisattva he promised to liberate all living beings from samsara, he revealed three final vehicles to some Hinayanists. This was not Buddha’s ultimate intention, but simply a device to bestow temporary happiness on his Hinayana disciples.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">For example, there is a legend that long ago there was a skilful <a id="calibre_link-2611"></a>boatman endowed with <a id="calibre_link-2612"></a>miracle powers who sailed together with a large company of merchants to a jewel island where they hoped to gather a great treasure of jewels. Fearing that his companions might be reluctant to embark if the journey seemed too long and arduous, the skilful boatman used his miracle powers to manifest another island much closer to home on which was a beautiful city. When they reached this island the company put to shore and enjoyed the delights of the emanated island. Once they had rested and restored their strength the skilful boatman then took them on the remainder of the journey to the jewelled island and the marvellous treasure they had sought. In a similar way, Buddha, the Great Boatman endowed with supreme powers, finally leads all living beings across the vast ocean of samsara and solitary peace to the jewel island of great enlightenment. However, for his Hinayana disciples who weary at the prospect of such a long journey he presents the lower vehicles so that they can attain temporary peace. Thus he first leads them to the vehicles of a small and middling <a id="calibre_link-2613"></a><a id="calibre_link-2614"></a><a id="calibre_link-2615"></a>enlightenment whereby they can attain a complete abandonment of their delusions and the pacification of suffering and then, when their minds are trained, he leads them into the Mahayana path and thereby helps them to complete the journey to great enlightenment. To disciples with greater mental capacity, however, Buddha reveals the Mahayana path from the very beginning.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below"><span class="italic">Answer</span> No there is no limit. Buddhas will perform the <a id="calibre_link-2618"></a>twelve deeds continuously until samsara has ceased. For example, Buddhas will show the manner of newly attaining the most supreme, holy enlightenment for as many aeons as there are atoms among the tiniest atoms in all the Buddha Lands in all the ten directions. However, these secrets of Buddha should not be explained to those with little wisdom or small virtuous roots lest they develop doubts or wrong views.</p>

How could they dwell in a solitary peace?</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below"><span class="italic">Objection</span> <a id="calibre_link-2620"></a>Buddha Shakyamuni passed away when he was eighty-one. He did not remain until the end of space.</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para"><span class="italic">Reply</span> A similar point is raised in <a id="calibre_link-2621"></a><span class="italic">Sutra of Holy Golden Light</span>, where there is an extensive explanation of why Buddha showed the manner of passing away. It is true that Buddha Shakyamuni showed the manner of passing away at the age of eighty-one but this does not mean that he died like an ordinary being. Because Buddha Shakyamuni’s body is born from the perfection of wisdom, it is a deathless vajra body and it still remains to this day for those who have the pure karma to see it. Many practitioners, including <a id="calibre_link-2622"></a>Je Tsongkhapa when he was in retreat at <a id="calibre_link-2623"></a>Reting Monastery, have seen Buddha Shakyamuni’s body since he showed the manner of passing away. We should remember that what appears to the minds of ordinary beings is deceptive. It is not possible for ordinary beings who are bound by karmic obstructions to see directly holy beings who have attained a deathless state. If we want to understand how Buddha Shakyamuni’s body remains we need to think deeply about the nature of reality for a long time. And to understand the nature of a <a id="calibre_link-2624"></a>vajra body and how it is attained we need to study both Sutra and Secret Mantra extensively.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Some people refer to <a id="calibre_link-2625"></a><span class="italic">Sutra of the Fortunate Aeons</span> where each of the thousand Buddhas is said to have a finite life span, but this Sutra was given according to the way things appear to ordinary beings. In reality, Buddhas have infinite life spans because they have attained a deathless state. How could someone who is not free from ordinary <a id="calibre_link-2626"></a>birth, death and <a id="calibre_link-2627"></a>intermediate state be a Buddha?</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The distress of a mother for her child pained by eating poison does not compare to a Buddha’s <a id="calibre_link-2628"></a>compassion for living beings, all of whom he cherishes as if they were his very own family. Worldly beings, through the faults of the confusion in their minds, are strongly <a id="calibre_link-2629"></a>attracted to the poisonous food of the five contaminated <a id="calibre_link-2630"></a>objects of desire and to obtain them they repeatedly engage in negative actions. As a result they are tormented by the unceasing pains of samsara. Seeing this, out of their limitless compassion Buddhas will never go to a state of solitary peace but will remain in this world to help suffering beings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Worldly beings are unskilled because they lack the wisdom realizing emptiness. Thus they conceive things and non-things to be truly existent. Through the force of this <a id="calibre_link-2631"></a>true-grasping they are bound to <a id="calibre_link-2632"></a>samsara where they repeatedly experience <a id="calibre_link-2633"></a>suffering from the moment of birth through to the moment of death, repeatedly having to part with what they like and encounter what they do not like. Furthermore, evil beings who deny <a id="calibre_link-2634"></a>actions and their effects take <a id="calibre_link-2635"></a>lower rebirths where they experience unbearable suffering for inconceivably long periods. Because of this, these worldly beings are objects of compassion for the Buddhas. Therefore the Blessed Ones have turned their minds away from solitary peace and do not possess a solitary nirvana.</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And has been presented exactly according to</span></p>

			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.53] A Dharma such as this is not found elsewhere.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Likewise the system presented here</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Is not found elsewhere.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">The wise should understand this clearly.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.54] Frightened by the colour of the great ocean of Nagarjuna’s wisdom,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Some beings have kept this excellent system at a great distance.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Now, due to the nectar from the opening of the kumuta, which came from the unfolding of these verses,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">The hopes of Chandrakirti have been completely fulfilled.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.55] This profound and frightening thatness just explained will be realized by those with previous familiarity,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">But it will not be comprehended by others, even though they may have listened extensively.</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">Therefore, having seen these other systems made up by one’s own mind,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">You should abandon the mind that likes their treatises as you would systems that assert a self.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">This treatise, <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span>, which reveals the uncommon Madhyamika system, was not simply made up by its author but has been extracted by the monk Chandrakirti from the various treatises on the middle way, such as <a id="calibre_link-2641"></a><span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span>. It has been presented exactly according to the scriptures of definitive meaning such as the <a id="calibre_link-2642"></a><span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span> and the oral teachings that Chandrakirti received directly from Protector Nagarjuna. A Dharma such as this, that presents profound emptiness without error, is not found in other treatises that do not explain the middle way. Similarly the system presented here, which decisively refutes all other positions and conclusively establishes the uncommon view of the <a id="calibre_link-2643"></a>Madhyamika-Prasangika school by means of reasoning and scriptural citation, is not found in the Vaibhashika, Sautrantika, Chittamatra, or even the Madhyamika-Svatantrika systems. The wise should understand this clearly.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Madhyamika system arose from the extremely vast and deep ocean of Nagarjuna’s wisdom. Frightened by this vastness and profundity, some beings have kept this excellent system at a great distance. In reality, however, <span class="italic">Fundamental Wisdom</span> is like a beautiful kumuta flower that grew from the ocean of Nagarjuna’s wisdom, but because its verses were not understood its petals remained folded keeping the nectar of emptiness within. Through the power of the sunlight of Chandrakirti’s wisdom these petals have now unfolded and the precious nectar of emptiness has flowed forth completely fulfilling the hopes of Madhyamika scholars such as Chandrakirti.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">This profound <a id="calibre_link-2644"></a>thatness explained extensively in the sixth chapter is the foundation of real happiness for those who have wisdom, but it may appear frightening to those who do not. It will be realized by those who have previous familiarity with emptiness from their past lives and by those who have a great stock of wisdom, but it will not be comprehended by those who reject Nagarjuna’s system even though they may have listened extensively to teachings and studied many texts.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Some commentaries to the <span class="italic">Guide</span> take these lines to be a reference to scholars such as the Masters <a id="calibre_link-2645"></a>Dignaga and <a id="calibre_link-2646"></a>Vasubandhu because they presented systems outside Nagarjuna’s view. However, we cannot say that these scholars have not realized emptiness just because they presented other systems. These systems may not have been their final intention and they may have revealed them for some temporary purpose. Even so, many who are called Buddhist Masters have presented systems that are contrary to the <span class="italic">Perfection of Wisdom Sutras</span> and that are outside the view of Nagarjuna, and they have claimed these to be the highest systems. If we develop a mind that likes these treatises and teachings that are entirely made up without relying on Buddha’s teachings, it is similar to liking systems propounded by non-Buddhists that assert a permanent, partless, causeless self. Therefore, we should abandon any mind that likes to study or practise such incorrect treatises or teachings.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DEDICATING THE MERIT FROM COMPOSING THE TREATISE</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">[XI.56] Through the merit encompassing all directions that I have received from explaining the excellent system of Master Nagarjuna,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">That is as white as autumn stars in the sky of my mind darkened by delusions,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-middle"><span class="bold">And that is like a jewel on the hood of the snake of my mind,</span></p>
			<p class="text-quotation-verse-last"><span class="bold">May all worldly beings realize thatness and quickly attain the grounds of the Sugatas.</span></p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">In dedicating the merit from composing <span class="italic">Guide to the Middle Way</span>, <a id="calibre_link-2647"></a>Chandrakirti is characteristically humble. He confesses that the sky of his mind is darkened by delusions and that through the presence of these delusions his mind is like a poisonous snake. Nevertheless, the merit that he has received from explaining clearly and without error the excellent system of Master Nagarjuna by relying on reasoning and scriptural citation will benefit living beings encompassing all directions until the end of time. Because his merit is not tainted by even the slightest bad motivation it is as white as a radiant moon surrounded by stars in an autumn sky illuminating the darkness of the mind, and because it will bring immeasurable benefit to others it is like a jewel on the hood of the snake of the mind. Therefore Chandrakirti dedicates all this merit to benefit all living beings, ‘May all worldly beings realize thatness and quickly attain the grounds of the Sugatas.’</p>

			<p class="text-quotation-numbered-verse-middle-double">The Conquerors’ Son develops a bliss</p>
			<p class="text-quotation-numbered-verse-middle-double">The like of which is not aroused in the Able Ones through experiencing peace,</p>

			<p class="text-heading">DEFINITION</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of Vaibhashika is a person propounding Hinayana tenets who does not assert self-cognizers.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">There are many divisions, but they are all included within three:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Kashmiris</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	Aparantakas</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">3	Magadhas</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ETYMOLOGY</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">‘Vaibhashika’ means ‘Particularist’. They are so called because they propound tenets following <span class="italic">Great Treasury Explaining Particulars</span> and also because they propound the three times to be particular substances.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING OBJECTS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The definition of thing is able to perform a function. Thing, existent and object of knowledge are synonyms. There are two types of thing: permanent things and impermanent things. Examples of the first are non-produced space, analytical cessations and non-analytical cessations. Examples of the second are product and impermanent.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There is another twofold division of thing: conventional truths and ultimate truths. The definition of conventional truth is a phenomenon that is such that if it is destroyed or mentally separated into individual parts the mind apprehending it ceases. Examples are a vase and a woollen cloth. If a vase is smashed with a hammer the mind apprehending it ceases, and if a woollen cloth is separated into individual threads the mind apprehending it ceases.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of ultimate truth is a phenomenon that is such that if it is destroyed or mentally separated into individual parts, the mind apprehending it does not cease. Examples are directionally partless particles, temporally partless awareness and unproduced phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Furthermore, the Vaibhashikas assert that the three times are particular instances of one substance because a vase exists also at the time of the past of a vase, and at the time of the future of a vase.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING OBJECT-POSSESSORS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Some Vaibhashikas assert the mere collection of the five aggregates to be the person, and some assert the mental consciousness to be the person.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are two types of mind: valid cognizers and non-valid cognizers. There are two types of valid cognizer: direct valid cognizers and subsequent valid cognizers. There are three types of direct valid cognizer: valid sense direct perceivers, valid mental direct perceivers and valid yogic direct perceivers. Valid sense direct perceivers are not necessarily awarenesses because the eye sense power, for example, is a valid direct perceiver.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">There are two types of valid yogic direct perceiver: valid yogic direct perceivers realizing selflessness of persons and valid yogic direct perceivers realizing subtle impermanence. The first has two types: valid yogic direct perceivers realizing the lack of a permanent, partless, causeless person; and valid yogic direct perceivers realizing the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING SELFLESSNESS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The Vaibhashikas assert that selflessness and subtle selflessness of persons are synonyms. They do not assert selflessness of phenomena because they say that all objects of knowledge are pervaded by self of phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The Samittiyas assert a selflessness of persons that is a lack of a permanent, partless, causeless person; but they do not assert a selflessness of persons that is a lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person because they say that there exists a self-supporting, substantially existent self that is indescribable in terms of being the same or different nature from the aggregates, or in terms of being permanent or impermanent.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">PRESENTATION OF GROUNDS AND PATHS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This has two parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Objects to be abandoned</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Actual presentation of grounds and paths</p>
			<p class="text-heading">OBJECTS TO BE ABANDONED</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">They assert two types of obstruction: delusion-obstructions and non-delusion-obstructions. Delusion-obstructions function principally to obstruct the attainment of liberation and non-delusion-obstructions function principally to obstruct the attainment of an all-knowing mind. However, they do not talk of ‘obstructions to omniscience’. Examples of the first are the mind conceiving a self-supporting, substantially existent person, and the three poisons together with their seeds that arise through its power. Examples of the second are the imprints of the mind conceiving a self-supporting, substantially existent person and the mental distortion that arises through their power.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ACTUAL PRESENTATION OF GROUNDS AND PATHS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">There are differences in the way in which the persons of the three vehicles progress on the paths. Those of the Hearer lineage meditate on the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person with a small collection of merit for three lives or more and attain a small enlightenment. Those of the Solitary Realizer lineage meditate on the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person with a middling collection of merit for a hundred aeons or more and attain a middling enlightenment. Bodhisattvas meditate on the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person with a great collection of merit for three countless great aeons or more and attain a great enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are differences in the way in which they accumulate merit. Bodhisattvas accumulate merit for three countless great aeons on the great stage of the path of accumulation and below, and then progress from the heat stage of the path of preparation through to the Path of No More Learning in one session. Those of the Solitary Realizer lineage accumulate merit for a hundred great aeons on the great stage of the path of accumulation and below, and then progress from the heat stage of the path of preparation through to the Path of No More Learning in one session. Those of the Hearer lineage accumulate merit while on all four learning paths; and they have to train on the learning paths for anything up to fourteen lifetimes even after they have attained superior paths.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Vaibhashikas assert that the form aggregate of a Buddha is not Buddha because it is an object to be abandoned. This is because it is included within the same life as the body of the Bodhisattva on the path of preparation, and that body is an aggregate arisen from previous karma and delusion. They do not accept an Enjoyment Body, and they assert that when the Supreme Emanation Body, Buddha, attained nirvana without remainder his mental continuum ceased. Even though Buddhas have abandoned all delusions that observe true sufferings they still have true sufferings within their mental continuum.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Vaibhashikas assert that Hearer and Solitary Realizer Foe Destroyers possess a nirvana with remainder from the attainment of the state of Foe Destroyer until they pass away, and that when they pass away they attain a nirvana without remainder. At the time of nirvana with remainder, even though they have abandoned all delusion-obstructions, they have not abandoned non-delusion-obstructions. Their non-delusion-obstructions cease at the time of nirvana without remainder, not because they are destroyed through the force of antidotes but because at that time the mental continuum that is their basis has ceased.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Proponents of things distinguish definitive and interpretative Sutras according to whether or not they can be taken literally. The two lower schools do not accept Mahayana Sutras to be the words of Buddha. Most Vaibhashikas believe that Sutras are necessarily Sutras of definitive meaning.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">EXPLANATION OF THE SYSTEM OF THE <a id="calibre_link-2661"></a>SAUTRANTIKAS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This has seven parts:</p>

			<p class="text-heading">DEFINITION</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of Sautrantika is a person propounding Hinayana tenets who asserts self-cognizers.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">There are two divisions:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Sautrantikas following scripture, for example Sautrantikas who rely on Vasubandhu’s <span class="italic">Treasury of Abhidharma</span></p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Sautrantikas following reasoning, for example Sautrantikas who rely on Dharmakirti’s <span class="italic">Seven Treatises of Valid Cognition</span></p>
			<p class="text-heading">ETYMOLOGY</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">‘Sautrantika’ means ‘Sutra Follower’. They are so called because they propound tenets following Buddha’s Hinayana Sutras.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING OBJECTS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The definition of existent is observed by a valid cognizer. There are two types: ultimate truths and conventional truths. The definition of ultimate truth is a phenomenon that is ultimately able to perform a function. Ultimate truth, truly existent, thing, product, impermanent, compounded phenomenon, substance and specifically characterized phenomenon are synonyms. The definition of conventional truth is a phenomenon that is not ultimately able to perform a function. Conventional truth, falsely existent, permanent and generally characterized phenomenon are synonyms.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There is another twofold division of existent: negative phenomena and affirmative phenomena. The definition of negative phenomenon is an object that is realized through the mind that apprehends it eliminating an object of negation. The definition of affirmative phenomenon is an object that is realized through the mind that apprehends it not eliminating an object of negation. There are two types of negative phenomenon: non-affirming negatives and affirming negatives. Examples of the first are unproduced space, true cessations and emptiness. Examples of the second are the opposite of non-thing and the appearance of the opposite of non-vase to a mind conceiving vase.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Furthermore, past and future are permanent; present and thing are synonyms.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING OBJECT-POSSESSORS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The Sautrantikas relying on <span class="italic">Treasury of Abhidharma</span> assert the continuum of the aggregates to be the person and the Sautrantikas relying on <span class="italic">Seven Treatises of Valid Cognition</span> assert the mental consciousness to be the person.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of mind is that which is clarity and cognizing. There are two types of mind: valid cognizers and non-valid cognizers. The definition of valid cognizer is a freshly, non-deceptive cognizer. It is necessary to state the three, ‘freshly’, ‘non-deceptive’ and ‘cognizer’ as borders of the definition of valid cognizer because by stating ‘freshly’ re-cognizers are excluded from being valid cognizers, by stating ‘non-deceptive’ correct beliefs are excluded from being valid cognizers, and by stating ‘cognizer’ sense powers possessing form are excluded from being valid cognizers.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are two types of valid cognizer: direct valid cognizers and subsequent valid cognizers. The definition of direct valid cognizer is a freshly, non-deceptive cognizer that is free from conceptuality. There are four types of direct valid cognizer: valid self-cognizing direct perceivers, valid sense direct perceivers, valid mental direct perceivers and valid yogic direct perceivers.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of direct perceiver is a cognizer that is free from conceptuality and non-mistaken. The definition of self-cognizing direct perceiver is that part of an apprehender that only looks inwards. The definition of sense direct perceiver is a cognizer free from conceptuality that arises in dependence on its uncommon dominant condition, a sense power possessing form. The definition of mental direct perceiver is a cognizer free from conceptuality that arises in dependence on its uncommon dominant condition, a mental power. The definition of yogic direct perceiver is a direct perceiver that realizes a subtle object directly, in dependence on its uncommon dominant condition, a concentration that is a union of tranquil abiding and superior seeing. There are three types of yogic direct perceiver: yogic direct perceivers realizing subtle impermanence, yogic direct perceivers realizing gross selflessness of persons and yogic direct perceivers realizing subtle selflessness of persons.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of subsequent cognizer is a conceiving cognizer whose object is realized in dependence on a conclusive reason. There are three types: subsequent cognizers through the power of fact, subsequent cognizers through belief and subsequent cognizers through renown. A subsequent cognizer through renown is necessarily a subsequent cognizer through the power of fact.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Direct perceivers are not necessarily direct valid cognizers and subsequent cognizers are not necessarily subsequent valid cognizers because both the second moment of a sense direct perceiver apprehending form and the second moment of a subsequent cognizer realizing impermanent sound are re-cognizers.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The definition of non-valid cognizer is a cognizer that is not freshly non-deceptive. There are five types:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Re-cognizers</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">2	Correct beliefs</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">3	Doubts</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">4	Non-ascertaining perceivers</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last">5	Wrong awarenesses</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The definition of re-cognizer is a cognizer that realizes what has already been realized through the force of a previous valid cognizer. There are two types: conceptual re-cognizers and non-conceptual re-cognizers.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of correct belief is a factually concordant conceiving cognizer that is deceptive in conceiving its object. There are five types: correct beliefs that do not depend on a reason, correct beliefs contradicting reason, correct beliefs with an indefinite reason, correct beliefs with an unestablished reason and correct beliefs where a reason exists without being realized.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of doubt is a mental factor that wavers with respect to its object. There are three types: doubts tending towards the truth, doubts tending away from the truth and balanced doubts.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of non-ascertaining perceiver is a non-mistaken cognizer to which a phenomenon that is its engaged object appears clearly without being ascertained. There are three types: non-ascertaining sense direct perceivers, non-ascertaining mental direct perceivers and non-ascertaining self-cognizing direct perceivers.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The definition of wrong awareness is a cognizer that is mistaken with respect to its engaged object. There are two types: conceptual wrong awarenesses and non-conceptual wrong awarenesses.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING SELFLESSNESS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">They assert the lack of a permanent, partless, causeless person to be gross selflessness of persons; and the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person to be subtle selflessness of persons. Like the Vaibhashikas they do not accept selflessness of phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">PRESENTATION OF GROUNDS AND PATHS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Members of all three lineages accumulate merit while on the four learning paths, therefore Buddha’s form aggregate is Buddha.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Their way of presenting obstructions, the way to progress through the grounds and paths and so forth, is similar to that of the Vaibhashikas.</p>
			<p class="text-heading"><a id="calibre_link-2662"></a>EXPLANATION OF THE SYSTEM OF THE <a id="calibre_link-2663"></a>CHITTAMATRINS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This has seven parts:</p>

			<p class="text-heading">DEFINITION</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of Chittamatrin is a person propounding Mahayana tenets who does not assert external objects and who asserts self-cognizers to be truly existent.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">There are two divisions:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	True Aspectarian Chittamatrins</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last">2	False Aspectarian Chittamatrins</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The True Aspectarians assert that although the five objects, form and so forth, are not external objects, they are gross objects. The False Aspectarians assert that they are not gross objects because if they were they would be external objects.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ETYMOLOGY</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">‘Chittamatrin’ means ‘Proponent of Mind Only’. They are so called because they assert that all phenomena are merely the nature of mind. Thus they assert that the five objects, form and so forth, are generated from the substance of inner consciousness in dependence on imprints of common and uncommon actions placed on the consciousness-basis-of-all, and so they are not external objects.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING OBJECTS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">There are two types of object of knowledge: ultimate truths and conventional truths. The definition of ultimate truth is an object realized by a valid cognizer that realizes it directly by means of dualistic appearance subsiding. Ultimate truth, nature of reality, sphere of phenomena and final condition are synonyms. There are two types of ultimate truth: subtle selflessness of phenomena and subtle selflessness of persons. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are twenty types of subtle selflessness of phenomena by way of bases of emptiness. When these are condensed there are eighteen. When these are condensed there are sixteen. When these are condensed there are four emptinesses and so on.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Examples of subtle selflessness of phenomena are the emptiness that is a form and a form-apprehending valid cognizer’s lack of being other substances, and the emptiness that is a form’s lack of existing by way of its own characteristics as a basis for applying the name ‘form’. An example of subtle selflessness of persons is the emptiness that is the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The definition of conventional truth is an object realized by a valid cognizer that realizes it directly with dualistic appearance. There are two types: other-powered phenomena and uncompounded phenomena other than ultimate truths.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">They refer to impermanent phenomena as ‘other-powered phenomena’ and assert them to be truly existent but false. They refer to emptinesses as ‘natures of reality’ and assert them to be truly existent and true. They refer to uncompounded phenomena other than emptiness as ‘imaginaries’ and assert them to be falsely existent and false. They say that all natures of reality are non-affirming negatives. They explain other non-affirming negatives in the same way as the Sautrantikas.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING OBJECT-POSSESSORS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The True Aspectarians assert a collection of eight consciousnesses: the six consciousnesses asserted by the other proponents of tenets, together with a consciousness-basis-of-all and a deluded mentality. The consciousness-basis-of-all is a seventh consciousness that is other than the six consciousnesses. They assert that the consciousness-basis-of-all is the person who is the basis of actions and effects. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The False Aspectarians assert a collection of six consciousnesses and they say that the mental consciousness is the person who is the basis of actions and effects.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The Chittamatrins assert two types of mind: valid cognizers and non-valid cognizers. They assert two types of valid cognizer: direct valid cognizers and subsequent valid cognizers. There are four types of direct valid cognizer: valid sense direct perceivers, valid mental direct perceivers, valid self-cognizing direct perceivers and valid yogic direct perceivers.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Self-cognizing direct perceivers and yogic direct perceivers are necessarily non-mistaken awareness. Sense direct perceivers in the continuums of ordinary beings are necessarily mistaken awareness. Mental direct perceivers in the continuums of ordinary beings can be either mistaken or non-mistaken.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">There are four types of yogic direct perceiver: yogic direct perceivers directly realizing subtle impermanence, subtle selflessness of persons, gross selflessness of persons, and subtle selflessness of phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING SELFLESSNESS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">They assert gross and subtle selflessness of persons in the same way as the Sautrantikas.

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">They assert delusion-obstructions to be self-grasping of persons together with its seeds, and the three poisons together with their seeds that arise through their power. They assert obstructions to omniscience to be self-grasping of phenomena together with its seeds, its imprints, and all the mistaken dualistic appearance that arises through their power.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ACTUAL PRESENTATION OF GROUNDS AND PATHS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Their assertions regarding the way members of the Hearer and Solitary Realizer lineages progress on the paths is the same as the assertions of the Vaibhashikas and Sautrantikas. They say that Bodhisattvas take as their object of meditation the emptiness that is apprehender and apprehended’s lack of being other substances. By meditating on this for three countless great aeons for the sake of others they attain great enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The True Aspectarians assert that when Hearer and Solitary Realizer Foe Destroyers pass beyond sorrow without remainder, their mental continuums cease. They assert that it is not possible for the mental continuum of a Buddha to cease because Bodhisattvas first attain Buddhahood in an Enjoyment Body in Akanishta and that Enjoyment Body, with an uninterrupted continuum of the same aspect, works for the welfare of others through various emanations according to the fortune of disciples until samsara ceases. They assert that the three vehicles are definite in their own final lineages because since beginningless time living beings have had three different lineages or dispositions; and due to these, three different inclinations; and due to these, three different practices; and due to these they attain three different final results.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The False Aspectarians do not assert that when Hearers and Solitary Realizer Foe Destroyers pass beyond sorrow without remainder their mental continuums cease. They assert that at that time the continuum of only the consciousness that is the nature of true suffering and true origins ceases. However a mere consciousness does go to the ground of Buddhahood, and therefore they assert the existence of one final vehicle.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of the first is a proponent of Madhyamika tenets who asserts nominalities mostly in accordance with the Sautrantikas. The definition of the second is a proponent of Madhyamika tenets who asserts nominalities mostly in accordance with the Chittamatrins. Examples of the first are Bhavaviveka and Gyanagarbha; and examples of the second are Shantirakshita, Haribhadra and Kamalashila.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ETYMOLOGY</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">‘Svatantrika’ means ‘Autonomist’. They are so called because they assert autonomous syllogisms and autonomous conclusive reasons possessing the three modes.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING OBJECTS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">Existing by way of its own characteristics, existing from its own side and existing inherently are synonyms. They assert that all phenomena exist in these three ways. They assert unproduced space, true cessations, past, future, and subtle selflessness of persons to be both non-affirming negatives and conventional truths. Ultimate truth, nature of reality and subtle selflessness of phenomena are synonyms.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The Sautrantika-Madhyamika-Svatantrikas assert that the five objects, form and so forth, are different entities from awareness and are gross external objects composed of partless particles. The Yogachara-Madhyamika-Svatantrikas assert that they are the same entity as the awareness apprehending them.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING OBJECT-POSSESSORS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">They assert a collection of six consciousnesses, and that the mental consciousness is the person.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are two types of mind: valid cognizers and non-valid cognizers. There are two types of valid cognizer: direct valid cognizers and subsequent valid cognizers. The Sautrantika-Madhyamika-Svatantrikas do not assert self-cognizing direct perceivers. The Yogachara-Madhyamika-Svatantrikas assert all four types of direct perceiver. They say that self-cognizing direct perceivers and yogic direct perceivers are necessarily non-mistaken awareness; the other two can be either mistaken or non-mistaken.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The Sautrantikas, Chittamatrins and Svatantrikas all assert that direct perceivers are necessarily non-conceptual awareness, that re-cognizers are necessarily non-valid awareness, that an awareness mistaken with respect to its conceived object is necessarily a wrong awareness, that an awareness that is mistaken with respect to a particular phenomenon is necessarily a non-valid cognizer with respect to that phenomenon, and that subsequent cognizers are necessarily non-valid cognizers with respect to their appearing objects.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING SELFLESSNESS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">They assert the lack of a permanent, partless, causeless person to be gross selflessness of persons; and the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person to be subtle selflessness of persons. The Yogachara-Madhyamika-Svatantrikas assert a form and a form-apprehending valid cognizer’s lack of being other substances to be gross selflessness of phenomena; and all phenomena’s lack of true existence to be subtle selflessness of phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The two selflessnesses are distinguished by way of their object of negation, not by way of their bases of emptiness. Thus the negation of true existence on the basis of a person is subtle selflessness of phenomena; and the negation of self-supporting, substantial existence on the basis of a person is subtle selflessness of persons.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The two self-graspings are distinguished by way of the manner of grasping, not by way of their observed object. Thus grasping at true existence observing the basis person is self-grasping of phenomena, and grasping at self-supporting, substantial existence observing the basis person is self-grasping of persons.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">PRESENTATION OF GROUNDS AND PATHS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The Yogachara-Madhyamika-Svatantrikas posit the differences between the persons of the three vehicles in terms of three different obstructions that are the principal objects to be abandoned, and three different views that are the principal objects of meditation. They say that members of the Hearer lineage take the mind conceiving a self-supporting, substantially existent person as their principal object to be abandoned. By meditating on its antidote, the view realizing the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person as their principal object of meditation, they attain a small enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Members of the Solitary Realizer lineage take the mind conceiving a form and a form-apprehending valid cognizer to be different substances as their principal object to be abandoned. By meditating on its antidote, the view realizing apprehender and apprehended’s lack of being different substances as their principal object of meditation they attain a middling enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">Bodhisattvas take true-grasping together with its imprints as their principal object to be abandoned. By meditating on its antidote, the view realizing the lack of true existence of all phenomena, as their principal object of meditation, they attain a great enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">According to the Sautrantika-Madhyamika-Svatantrikas there is no difference between Hearers and Solitary Realizers in terms of their principal object to be abandoned or their principal object of meditation because they both take delusion-obstructions as their principal object to be abandoned and selflessness of persons as their principal object of meditation. However the latter are said to be superior because they accumulate a greater collection of merit over a longer period of time and so attain a greater enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The Madhyamika-Svatantrikas assert two types of Sutra: Mahayana Sutras and Hinayana Sutras, and like the Chittamatrins they assert that these are divided into Sutras of interpretative meaning and Sutras of definitive meaning. The Chittamatrins assert that the Sutras of the first two Dharma Wheels are of interpretative meaning, and that the Sutras of the third Wheel are of definitive meaning. The Madhyamika-Svatantrikas assert that the Sutras of the first and third Wheels are of interpretative meaning, and that the second Wheel includes both Sutras of interpretative meaning and Sutras of definitive meaning. They say that Sutras of the second Wheel in which the term ‘ultimate’ is applied to the object of negation are of definitive meaning, and those where it is not applied are of interpretative meaning.</p>

			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">The definition of <a id="calibre_link-2665"></a>Madhyamika-Prasangika is a proponent of Madhyamika tenets who does not assert inherent existence even nominally.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">DIVISIONS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Examples are Buddhapalita, Chandrakirti and Shantideva.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ETYMOLOGY</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">‘Prasangika’ means ‘Consequentialist’. They are so called because they assert that a subsequent cognizer realizing what is to be established can be generated in the continuum of an opponent by stating a mere consequence.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING OBJECTS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">There are two types of object: manifest object and hidden object. The definition of manifest object is an object whose initial realization by a valid cognizer does not depend on logical reasons. The definition of hidden object is an object whose initial realization by a valid cognizer depends on correct logical reasons.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There is another twofold division of object: conventional truths and ultimate truths. The definition of conventional truth is the principal object of a valid cognizer that apprehends a false object. In general, it is not suitable to divide conventional truths into correct conventional truths and incorrect conventional truths because all conventional truths are false objects. Conventional truths can be divided into correct and incorrect with respect to the awareness of worldly beings because form is correct with respect to the awareness of worldly beings and the reflection of a face in a mirror is incorrect with respect to the awareness of worldly beings. However, if something is correct with respect to the awareness of worldly beings it does not necessarily exist, for example truly existent form.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The definition of ultimate truth is the principal object of a valid cognizer that apprehends a truth. The divisions are the same as for the Chittamatrins, except that the Madhyamika-Prasangikas assert that true cessations are necessarily ultimate truths.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING OBJECT-POSSESSORS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The Madhyamika-Prasangikas assert that the mere I imputed in dependence on the five aggregates is the person; and that a person is necessarily a non-associated compounded phenomenon.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are two types of mind: valid cognizers and non-valid cognizers. There are two types of valid cognizer: direct valid cognizers and subsequent valid cognizers. They do not assert self-cognizing direct perceivers. Sense awareness in the continuum of sentient beings is necessarily mistaken awareness. Mental awareness and yogic direct perceivers can be either mistaken or non-mistaken.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are two types of direct valid cognizer: conceptual direct valid cognizers and non-conceptual direct valid cognizers. Examples of the first are the second moment of a subsequent cognizer realizing impermanent sound, and a remembering awareness correctly remembering blue that is generated through being induced by a sense direct perceiver apprehending blue. An instance of the second is a sense direct perceiver apprehending form. Re-cognizers are necessarily direct valid cognizers.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">There are four types of subsequent cognizer: subsequent cognizers through the power of fact, subsequent cognizers through renown, subsequent cognizers through example and subsequent cognizers through belief. Both subsequent cognizers through renown and cognizers through example are included within subsequent cognizers through the power of fact.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Subsequent cognizers are mistaken with respect to their conceived object. If it is an awareness it necessarily realizes its determined object. For example, a mind conceiving a horned rabbit realizes its determined object, the generic image of a horned rabbit.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">WAY OF ASSERTING SELFLESSNESS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">The Madhyamika-Prasangikas assert the lack of a self-supporting, substantially existent person to be gross selflessness of persons, and a person’s lack of true existence to be subtle selflessness of persons. The lack of true existence of phenomena other than persons is subtle selflessness of phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">The two selflessnesses are distinguished by way of their bases of emptiness, not by way of their object of negation. Thus the negation of true existence on the basis of a person is subtle selflessness of persons and the negation of true existence on the basis of the aggregates and so forth is subtle selflessness of phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">The two self-graspings are distinguished by way of their observed object, not by way of the manner of grasping. Thus grasping at true existence observing a person is self-grasping of persons, and grasping at true existence observing the aggregates and so forth is self-grasping of phenomena.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">PRESENTATION OF GROUNDS AND PATHS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-space-below">This has two parts:</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-middle">1	Objects to be abandoned</p>
			<p class="text-list-1-to-9-last-full-space-below">2	Actual presentation of grounds and paths</p>
			<p class="text-heading">OBJECTS TO BE ABANDONED</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para-full-space-below">Gross and subtle self-grasping together with their seeds, and the attachment and so forth together with their seeds that arise through their power, are delusion-obstructions, and obstructions that principally obstruct the attainment of liberation. The imprints of true-grasping and all the mistaken dualistic appearance that arises through their power are obstructions to omniscience and obstructions that principally obstruct the attainment of an omniscient mind.</p>
			<p class="text-heading">ACTUAL PRESENTATION OF GROUNDS AND PATHS</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">For the persons of the three vehicles there are no differences of superiority in the views that are their objects of meditation because all three take subtle selflessness of persons and subtle selflessness of phenomena as their principal objects of meditation. There are differences in their principal objects to be abandoned. Hearers and Solitary Realizers take the two self-graspings together with their seeds as their principal object to be abandoned, and Bodhisattvas take the imprints of the two self-graspings as their principal object to be abandoned.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Members of the Mahayana lineage who are definite in the lineage from the beginning abandon delusion-obstructions and attain the eighth ground simultaneously, and they abandon obstructions to omniscience and manifest the four bodies simultaneously.</p>

			<p class="chapter-title-toc-level1">Introduction</p>
			<p class="text-1st-para">We all have the potential to gain realizations of all the stages of the path to enlightenment. These potentials are like seeds in the field of our mind, and our meditation practice is like cultivating these seeds. However, our meditation practice will be successful only if we make good preparations beforehand.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">If we want to cultivate external crops, we begin by making careful preparations. First, we remove from the soil anything that might obstruct their growth, such as stones and weeds. Second, we enrich the soil with compost or fertilizer to give it the strength to sustain growth. Third, we provide warm, moist conditions to enable the seeds to germinate and the plants to grow. In the same way, to cultivate our inner crops of Dharma realizations we must also begin by making careful preparations. </p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para">First, we must purify our mind to eliminate the negative karma we have accumulated in the past, because if we do not purify this karma it will obstruct the growth of Dharma realizations. Second, we need to give our mind the strength to support the growth of Dharma realizations by accumulating merit. Third, we need to activate and sustain the growth of Dharma realizations by receiving the blessings of the holy beings.</p>
			<p class="text-2nd-para-space-below">The brief prayers that follow contain the essence of these three preparations. For more information on them, see the books <span class="italic">The New Meditation Handbook</span> or <span class="italic">Joyful Path of Good Fortune</span>.</p>

The fourth, of which each Buddha manifests a countless number, are gross Form Bodies that are visible to ordinary beings.

			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="bold-italic">Meditation</span><span class="bold-italic"> </span>Meditation is a mind that concentrates on a virtuous object and is a mental action that is the main cause of mental peace. There are two types of meditation &ndash; analytical meditation and placement meditation. When we use our imagination, mindfulness and powers of reasoning to find our object of meditation, this is analytical meditation. When we find our object and hold it single-pointedly, this is placement meditation. There are different types of object. Some, such as impermanence or emptiness, are objects apprehended by the mind. Others, such as love, compassion and renunciation, are actual states of mind. We engage in analytical meditation until the specific object that we seek appears clearly to our mind or until the particular state of mind that we wish to generate arises. This object or state of mind is our object of placement meditation. See <span class="italic">The New Meditation Handbook</span>.</p>

			<p id="calibre_link-2674" class="chapter-title-toc-level"><a id="calibre_link-44"></a><a id="calibre_link-110"></a>Study Programmes of Kadampa Buddhism</p>
			<p class="study-program-text"><a id="calibre_link-2675"></a>Kadampa Buddhism is a Mahayana Buddhist school founded by the great Indian Buddhist Master <a id="calibre_link-2676"></a>Atisha (<span class="small-caps">AD</span> 982-1054). His followers are known as ‘Kadampas’. ‘Ka’ means ‘word’ and refers to Buddha’s teachings, and ‘dam’ refers to Atisha’s special <a id="calibre_link-2677"></a>Lamrim instructions known as ‘the stages of the path to enlightenment’. By integrating their knowledge of all <a id="calibre_link-2678"></a>Buddha’s teachings into their practice of Lamrim, and by integrating this into their everyday lives, Kadampa Buddhists are encouraged to use Buddha’s teachings as practical methods for transforming daily activities into the path to enlightenment. The great Kadampa Teachers are famous not only for being great scholars but also for being spiritual practitioners of immense purity and sincerity.</p>
			<p class="study-program-text-2nd-para">The <a id="calibre_link-2679"></a>lineage of these teachings, both their oral transmission and blessings, was then passed from Teacher to disciple, spreading throughout much of Asia, and now to many countries throughout the Western world. Buddha’s teachings, which are known as ‘<a id="calibre_link-2680"></a><a id="calibre_link-2681"></a>Dharma’, are likened to a wheel that moves from country to country in accordance with changing conditions and people’s karmic inclinations. The external forms of presenting Buddhism may change as it meets with different cultures and societies, but its essential authenticity is ensured through the continuation of an unbroken lineage of realized practitioners.</p>
			<p class="study-program-text-2nd-para">Kadampa Buddhism was first introduced into the West in 1977 by the renowned Buddhist Master, Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso Rinpoche. Since that time, he has worked tirelessly to spread Kadampa Buddhism throughout the world by giving extensive teachings, writing many profound texts on Kadampa Buddhism, and founding the <a id="calibre_link-2682"></a>New Kadampa Tradition &ndash; International Kadampa Buddhist Union (NKT-IKBU), which now has over 1200 Kadampa Buddhist Centres and groups worldwide. Each Centre offers study programmes on Buddhist psychology, philosophy and meditation instruction, as well as retreats for all levels of practitioner. The emphasis is on integrating Buddha’s teachings into daily life to solve our human problems and to spread lasting peace and happiness throughout the world.</p>
			<p class="study-program-text-2nd-para">The Kadampa Buddhism of the NKT-IKBU is an entirely independent Buddhist tradition and has no political affiliations. It is an association of Buddhist Centres and practitioners that derive their inspiration and guidance from the example of the ancient Kadampa Buddhist Masters and their teachings, as presented by Venerable Geshe Kelsang.</p>
			<p class="study-program-text-2nd-para">There are three reasons why we need to study and practise the teachings of Buddha: to develop our wisdom, to cultivate a good heart, and to maintain a peaceful state of mind. If we do not strive to develop our <a id="calibre_link-2683"></a>wisdom, we will always remain ignorant of <a id="calibre_link-2684"></a>ultimate truth &ndash; the true nature of reality. Although we wish for <a id="calibre_link-2685"></a>happiness, our <a id="calibre_link-2686"></a>ignorance leads us to engage in non-virtuous actions, which are the main cause of all our <a id="calibre_link-2687"></a>suffering. If we do not cultivate a good heart, our selfish motivation destroys harmony and good relationships with others. We have no peace, and no chance to gain pure happiness. Without inner peace, outer peace is impossible. If we do not maintain a peaceful state of mind, we are not happy even if we have ideal conditions. On the other hand, when our mind is peaceful, we are happy, even if our external conditions are unpleasant. Therefore, the development of these qualities is of utmost importance for our daily happiness.</p>
			<p class="study-program-text-2nd-para-full-space-below">Venerable Geshe Kelsang, or ‘Geshe-la’ as he is affectionately called by his students, has designed three special spiritual programmes for the systematic study and practice of Kadampa Buddhism that are especially suited to the modern world &ndash; the General Programme (GP), the Foundation Programme (FP), and the Teacher Training Programme (TTP).</p>
			<p class="sadhana-heading-3-centre"><span class="small-caps-bold">GENERAL PROGRAMME</span></p>
			<p class="study-program-text-full-space-below">The General Programme provides a basic introduction to Buddhist view, meditation and practice that is suitable for beginners. It also includes advanced teachings and practice from both Sutra and Tantra.</p>
			<p class="sadhana-heading-3-centre"><span class="small-caps-bold">FOUNDATION PROGRAMME</span></p>
			<p class="biblio-text">The Foundation Programme provides an opportunity to deepen our understanding and experience of Buddhism through a systematic study of six texts:</p>
			<p class="study-program-list-middle">1	<span class="italic">Joyful Path of Good Fortune</span> &ndash; a commentary to Atisha’s Lamrim instructions, the stages of the path to enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="study-program-list-middle">2	<span class="italic">Universal Compassion</span> &ndash; a commentary to Bodhisattva Chekhawa’s <span class="italic">Training the Mind in Seven Points</span>.</p>
			<p class="study-program-list-middle">3	<span class="italic">The New Eight Steps to Happiness</span> &ndash; a commentary to Bodhisattva Langri Tangpa’s <span class="italic">Eight Verses of Training the Mind</span>.</p>
			<p class="study-program-list-middle">4	<span class="italic">The New Heart of Wisdom</span> &ndash; a commentary to the <span class="italic">Heart Sutra</span>.</p>
			<p class="study-program-list-middle">5	<span class="italic">Meaningful to Behold</span> &ndash; a commentary to Bodhisattva Shantideva’s <span class="italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span>.</p>
			<p class="study-program-list-last">6	<span class="italic">How to Understand the Mind</span> &ndash; a detailed explanation of the mind, based on the works of the Buddhist scholars Dharmakirti and Dignaga.</p>
			<p class="biblio-text">The benefits of studying and practising these texts are as follows:</p>
			<p class="biblio-text">(1) <span class="italic">Joyful Path of Good Fortune</span> &ndash; we gain the ability to put all Buddha’s teachings of both Sutra and Tantra into practice. We can easily make progress on, and complete, the stages of the path to the supreme happiness of enlightenment. From a practical point of view, Lamrim is the main body of Buddha’s teachings, and the other teachings are like its limbs.</p>
			<p class="biblio-text">(2) and (3) <span class="italic">Universal Compassion</span> and <span class="italic">The New Eight Steps to Happiness</span> &ndash; we gain the ability to integrate Buddha’s teachings into our daily life and solve all our human problems.</p>
			<p class="biblio-text">(4) <span class="italic">The New Heart of Wisdom</span> &ndash; we gain a realization of the ultimate nature of reality. By gaining this realization, we can eliminate the ignorance of self-grasping, which is the root of all our suffering.</p>
			<p class="biblio-text">(5) <span class="italic">Meaningful to Behold</span> &ndash; we transform our daily activities into the Bodhisattva’s way of life, thereby making every moment of our human life meaningful.</p>
			<p class="study-program-text-full-space-below">(6) <span class="italic">How to Understand the Mind</span> &ndash; we understand the relationship between our mind and its external objects. If we understand that objects depend upon the subjective mind, we can change the way objects appear to us by changing our own mind. Gradually, we will gain the ability to control our mind and in this way solve all our problems.</p>
			<p class="sadhana-heading-3-centre">TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAMME</p>
			<p class="study-program-text">The Teacher Training Programme is designed for people who wish to train as authentic Dharma Teachers. In addition to completing the study of fourteen texts of Sutra and Tantra, which include the six texts mentioned above, the student is required to observe certain commitments with regard to behaviour and way of life, and to complete a number of meditation retreats.</p>
			<p class="study-program-text-2nd-para-space-below">A Special Teacher Training Programme is also held at Manjushri KMC, Ulverston, England, and can be studied at the centre or by correspondence. This special meditation and study programme consists of six courses spread over three years based on the books of Venerable Geshe Kelsang: <span class="italic">How to Understand the Mind</span>; <span class="italic">Modern Buddhism;</span> <span class="italic">The New Heart of Wisdom; Tantric Grounds and Paths; </span>Shantideva’s <span class="italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span> and its commentary,<span class="italic"> Meaningful to Behold;</span> and <span class="italic">Ocean of Nectar</span>.</p>
			<p class="study-program-text">All Kadampa Buddhist Centres are open to the public. Every year we celebrate Festivals in many countries throughout the world, including two in England, where people gather from around the world to receive special teachings and empowerments and to enjoy a spiritual holiday. Please feel free to visit us at any time!</p>
